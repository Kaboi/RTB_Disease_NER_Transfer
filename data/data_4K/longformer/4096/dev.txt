Mr. O

" O
For O
a O

let O

take O
the O
example O
of O

which O

the O

In O
fact O
, O
Cote B-GPE

The O

noted O
that O

He O
noted O
that O
local O

The O

can O
not O

the O

Researchers O
have O
discovered O
a O

species O
of O

christened O
" O
nanensis O

, O
belonging O
to O
the O
Musa B-CROP

, O
sharing O
a O
place O
in O
the O
family O
Musaceae O
with O
more O
than O
70 O
other O
species O
of O
bananas B-CROP
and O
plantains B-CROP
. O
Its O
scientific O
name O
honors O
the O
province O
of O
Nan B-GPE
where O
the O
type O
specimens O
were O
collected O
. O
  O
Here O
's O
a O
fun O
fact O
: O
every O
banana B-CROP
you O
've O
ever O
eaten O
— O
most O
likely O
a O
Cavendish B-CROP
— O
is O
genetically O
identical O
to O
all O
other O
bananas B-CROP
. O
  O
Why O
? O
Wild O
bananas B-CROP
contain O
big O
, O
hard O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
and O
very O
little O
flesh O
, O
making O
them O
almost O
inedible O
. O
Since O
its O
domestication O
over B-DATE
7000 I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
farmers O
have O
been O
hard O
at O
work O
selectively O
breeding O
the O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
to O
have O
really O
tiny O
, O
non O
- O
fertile O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
. O
Tasty O
, O
but O
not O
very O
practical O
— O
the O
lack O
of O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
means O
that O
growers O
must O
rely O
on O
" O
pups O
, O
" O
cuttings O
of O
an O
existent O
banana B-CROP
plant O
, O
to O
propagate O
crops O
. O
So O
basically O
, O
each O
one O
of O
the O
long O
yellow O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
you O
've O
purchased O
in O
a O
shop O
or O
grocery O
is O
thus O
genetically O
identical O
to O
all O
other O
bananas B-CROP
in O
the O
building O
. O
  O
One O
of O
the O
biggest O
concerns O
with O
having O
a O
whole O
species O
of O
clone O
organisms O
is O
that O
because O
they O
are O
genetically O
identical O
, O
they O
could O
all O
be O
wiped O
out O
by O
a O
single O
disease O
. O
Such O
was O
the O
case O
with O
the O
Cavendish B-CROP
's O
predecessor O
, O
the O
Gros B-CROP
Michel I-CROP
, O
that O
was O
wiped O
out O

maternal O

that O
