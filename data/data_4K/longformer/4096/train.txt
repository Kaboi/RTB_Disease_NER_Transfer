in O

although O
this O

This O

changed O
over O

time O
and O
relate O
that O
to O
the O
function O
of O

  O
Many O
of O
our O
domestic O

are O
polyploids O

many O
cereals O

While O
most O
of O
the O
genes O
resulting O
from O
such O
events O
are O
generally O
lost O
over O

time O

some O
persist O

the O
focus O
of O
my O

is O
on O

My O
area O
of O

is O
in O
yams B-CROP
and O
cacao B-CROP
, O
as O
well O
as O
other O
crops O
like O
taro B-CROP
and O
coffee B-CROP
. O
Most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
make O
any O
changes O
to O
crop O
traits O
of O

like O

This O
is O
when O
we O

  O
SW O
: O
This O
new O
project O
focuses O
on O
yams B-CROP
. O
Can O
you O
explain O
how O
important O
yams B-CROP
are O
agriculturally O
and O
as O
a O
food O
source O
? O
  O
RB O
: O
Firstly O
, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
in O
places O
such O
as O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
yams B-CROP
are O
often O
confused O
with O
sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
. O
However O
, O
they O
are O
two O
distinct O
crops O
belonging O
to O
two O
different O
families O
. O
Sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
are O
Ipomoea B-CROP
batatas I-CROP
, O
while O
yams B-CROP
belong O
to O
the O
genus O
Dioscorea O
. O
There O
are O
600 O
species O
of O
yams B-CROP
found O
all O
over O
the O
world O
covering O
Asia B-LOC
, O
Africa B-LOC
, O
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
Oceania B-GPE
and O
the O
Pacific B-LOC
. O
Out O
of O
these O
600 O
species O
, O
approximately O
10 O
are O
cultivated O
, O
such O
as O
Dioscorea B-CROP
rotundata I-CROP
, O
Dioscorea B-CROP
cayenensis I-CROP
and O
Dioscoria B-CROP
alata I-CROP
. O
  O
As O
yams B-CROP
are O
so O
widespread O
, O
they O
are O
very O
important O
as O
a O
food O
security O
crop O
for O
almost O
3 O
million O
people O
. O
They O
are O
the O
main O
crop O
for O
smallholder O
farmers O
that O
have O
between O
one O
to O
three O
hectares O
of O
land O
. O
Additionally O
, O
the O
cost O
of O
production O
of O
yams B-CROP
is O
very O
high O
, O
so O
yam B-CROP
farmers O
will O
often O
sell O
their O
yams B-CROP
to O
get O
the O
money O
to O
buy O
other O
crops O
– O
like O
cassava B-CROP
, O
maize B-CROP
or O
rice B-CROP
– O
which O
are O
much O
cheaper O
. O
Yams B-CROP
are O
also O
very O
rich O
in O
starch O
and O
are O
reported O
to O
have O
one O
of O
the O
lowest O
glycemic O
indexes O
compared O
to O
other O
starchy O
crops O
. O
  O
Yams B-CROP
are O
also O
an O
income O
- O
secured O
crop O
. O
There O
are O
reports O
that O
the O
market O
value O
is O
around O
$ O
13.7 O
billion O
, O
giving O
yams B-CROP
the O
nickname O
" O
King O
of O
Crops O
" O
in O
West B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
. O
Furthermore O
, O
yams B-CROP
contain O
valuable O
secondary O
metabolites O
like O
diosgenin O
, O
saponins O
and O
shikimic O
acid O
. O
These O
are O
important O
ingredients O
for O
pharmaceutical O
companies O
. O
These O
metabolites O
can O
be O
produced O
synthetically O
but O
can O
also O
be O
sourced O
naturally O
from O
certain O
species O
of O
yam B-CROP
. O
Therefore O
, O
if O
these O
can O
be O
extracted O
, O
this O
can O
provide O
a O
very O
large O
source O
of O
income O
. O
  O
SW O
: O
What O
would O
you O
say O
are O
the O
main O
challenges O
facing O
yam B-CROP
agriculture O
today B-DATE
? O
  O
RB O
: O
Issues O
such O
as O
low O
yield O
and O
diseases O
are O
the O
major O
challenges O
. O
There O
are O
diseases O
that O
affect O
certain O
yam B-CROP
species O
, O
for O
example O
, O
Dioscorea B-CROP
alata I-CROP
can O
develop O
a O
fungal O
infection O
caused O
by O
Colletotrichum B-PATHOGEN
gloeosporioides I-PATHOGEN
called O
anthracnose B-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
. O
Another O
yam B-CROP
species O
, O
Dioscorea B-CROP
rotundata I-CROP
, O
can O
contract O
a O
viral O
infection O
which O
results O
in O
yam B-DISEASE
mosaic I-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
. O
Both O
diseases O
can O
reduce O
crop O
yield O
by O
80 O
% O
or O
more O
. O
  O
The O
cost O
of O
production O
is O
another O
major O
challenge O
. O
As O
this O
crop O
is O
a O
vine O
, O
every O
plant O
needs O
to O
be O
staked O
in O
the O
ground O
. O
The O
lack O
of O
mechanization O
in O
West B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
makes O
both O
planting O
and O
harvesting O
very O
labor O
- O
intensive O
. O
These O
crops O
are O
underground O
tubers B-PLANT_PART
that O
can O
weigh O
up O
to O
eight O
or O
ten O
kilos O
, O
and O
each O
plant O
can O
produce O
multiple O
tubers B-PLANT_PART
. O
Another O
challenge O
is O
the O
seed B-PLANT_PART
system O
itself O
. O
As O
yams B-CROP
are O
a O
clonally O
propagated O
crop O
, O
farmers O
must O
keep O
some O
as O
planting O
material O
for O
seed B-PLANT_PART
tubers B-PLANT_PART
. O
This O
becomes O
very O
difficult O
for O
the O
farmers O
because O
they O
must O
keep O
seed B-PLANT_PART
tubers B-PLANT_PART
for O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
while O
also O
keeping O
some O
for O
their O
own O
consumption O
. O
  O
Lastly O
, O
there O
is O
the O
need O
for O
recognition O
of O
yams B-CROP
as O
a O
priority O
crop O
in O
West B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
. O
Nigeria B-GPE
is O
the O
highest O
producer O
of O
yams B-CROP
in O
the O
world O
, O
but O
policymakers O
and O
the O
government O
do O
n't O
recognize O
yams B-CROP
as O
a O
priority O
crop O
. O
This O
makes O
it O
very O
difficult O
to O
secure O
funding O
for O
research O
to O
make O
improvements O
, O
the O
rate O
of O
which O
in O
terms O
of O
genetics O
and O
genomics O
is O
very O
slow O
. O
When O
we O
speak O
to O
policymakers O
about O
why O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
prioritize O
these O
crops O
, O
they O
say O
that O
the O
production O
in O
Nigeria B-GPE
is O
so O
high O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
tubers B-PLANT_PART
are O
rotting B-SYMPTOM
. O
However O
, O
this O
is O
down O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
storage O
facilities O
post O
- O
harvest O
. O
When O
these O
crops O
are O
not O
stored O
properly O
and O
are O
stacked O
one O
on O
top O
of O
the O
other O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
is O
generated O
and O
the O
tubers B-PLANT_PART
can O
rot B-SYMPTOM
, O
be O
attacked O
by O
insects O
and O
become O
vulnerable O
to O
fungal O
infections O
. O
This O
means O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
crops O
can O
be O
lost O
. O

  O
RB O
: O
This O
award O
was O
initially O
supposed O
to O
do O
whole O
genome O
sequencing O
of O
only O
100 O
genotypes O
. O
However O
, O
after O
a O
lot O
of O
discussion O
with O
Illumina B-ORG
, O
I O
am O
very O
grateful O
that O
they O
have O
now O
recognized O
the O
value O
of O
this O
crop O
and O
allowed O
me O
to O
submit O
approximately O
1000 O
yam B-CROP
genotypes O
, O
including O
both O
cultivated O
and O
wild O
species O
. O
  O
One O
of O
the O
major O
issues O
with O
yams B-CROP
in O
West B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
is O
that O
two O
cultivated O
species O
– O
Dioscorea B-CROP
rotundata I-CROP
and O
Dioscorea B-CROP
cayenensis I-CROP
( O
also O
known O
as O
white B-CROP
yam I-CROP
and O
yellow B-CROP
yam I-CROP
, O
respectively O
) O
– O
are O
grown O
together O
with O
wild O
species O
. O
Farmers O
go O
into O
the O
forested O
areas O
and O
collect O
wild O
tubers B-PLANT_PART
, O
physically O
cultivating O
them O
into O
a O
regular O
, O
cylindrical O
shape O
which O
can O
take O
four B-DATE
or I-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O
These O
tubers B-PLANT_PART
are O
then O
referred O
to O
as O
cultivated O
white B-CROP
yams I-CROP
. O
However O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
confusion O
around O
whether O
these O
tubers B-PLANT_PART
are O
white B-CROP
yams I-CROP
, O
yellow B-CROP
yams I-CROP
, O
a O
wild O
– O
cultivated O
interspecific O
hybrid O
or O
a O
completely O
wild O
species O
. O
And O
if O
it O
is O
a O
wild O
species O
, O
which O
species O
is O
it O
? O
Therefore O
, O
in O
this O
project O
, O
the O
major O
aim O
is O
to O
do O
genome O
sequencing O
of O
many O
white O
, O
yellow O
and O
probable O
wild B-CROP
yams I-CROP
which O
are O
all O
grown O
together O
. O
With O
this O
, O
we O
can O
understand O
what O
the O
genetic O
relationship O
is O
between O
these O
cultivated O
and O
wild O
species O
. O
We O
will O
know O
whether O
these O
are O
white B-CROP
yams I-CROP
, O
yellow B-CROP
yams I-CROP
or O
interspecific O
hybrids O
. O
  O
For O
the O
second O
aim O
, O
we O
will O
investigate O
the O
viral O
DNA O
which O
is O
integrated O
within O
the O
yam B-CROP
genome O
and O
very O
difficult O
to O
separate O
. O
We O
will O
perform O
whole O
genome O
sequencing O
of O
100 O
isolates O
of O
viruses O
that O
we O
have O
extracted O
from O
the O
yams B-CROP
themselves O
. O
This O
will O
allow O
us O
to O
find O
the O
regions O
for O
viral O
resistance O
in O
the O
yam B-CROP
genome O
. O
Interestingly O
, O
we O
have O
the O
draft O
reference O
genome O
already O
available O
for O
the O
white B-CROP
yam I-CROP
, O
meaning O
we O
can O
align O
the O
sequencing O
data O
with O
the O
available O
draft O
reference O
genome O
. O
This O
will O
allow O
us O
to O
find O
regions O
of O
conserved O
resistance O
genes O
as O
well O
as O
genes O
for O
other O
important O
quality O
traits O
such O
as O
dry O
matter O
content O
and O
starch O
quality O
. O
  O
SW O
: O
How O
might O
this O
research O
increase O
the O
sustainability O
and O
productivity O
of O
this O
crop O
? O
  O
RB O
: O
It O
may O
not O
directly O
and O
immediately O
impact O
the O
sustainability O
and O
the O
production O
of O
the O
crop O
. O
However O
, O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
once O
we O
understand O
the O
genes O
that O
are O
responsible O
for O
different O
traits O
, O
we O
can O
perform O
genomics O
- O
assisted O
breeding O
and O
fast O
- O
track O
the O
breeding O
cycle O
. O
  O
Currently O
, O
it O
can O
take O
eight B-DATE
to I-DATE
ten I-DATE
years I-DATE
to O
generate O
a O
new O
yam B-CROP
variety O
, O
and O
the O
varietal O
turnover O
is O
very O
low O
. O
Furthermore O
, O
when O
improved O
varieties O
are O
finally O
released O
to O
the O
farmers O
, O
the O
adoption O
rate O
of O
improved O
varieties O
is O
also O
very O
low O
. O
Producers O
rely O
on O
" O
landraces O
" O
, O
which O
are O
the O
farmers O
' O
locally O
adapted O
varieties O
. O
From O
a O
metabolomic O
study O
, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
landraces O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
improved O
varieties O
. O
So O
, O
when O
we O
try O
to O
improve O
a O
variety O
, O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
negative O
correlation O
between O
the O
yield O
and O
some O
of O
the O
quality O
traits O
like O
starch O
properties O
, O
minerals O
and O
taste O
. O
With O
whole O
genome O
sequencing O
, O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
find O
the O
genes O
responsible O
for O
these O
traits O
and O
perform O
genomics O
- O
assisted O
breeding O
to O
transfer O
these O
genes O
into O
some O
of O
these O
improved O
varieties O
. O
  O
Genome O
sequencing O
is O
also O
going O
to O
generate O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
data O
, O
so O
we O
need O
to O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
gene O
mining O
and O
understand O
whether O
these O
genes O
are O
functional O
. O
However O
, O
this O
will O
take O
much O
less O
time O
than O
for O
many O
other O
crops O
, O
as O
things O
are O
already O
being O
understood O
in O
other O
crop O
species O
. O
For O
example O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
has O
gone O
into O
improving O
our O
understanding O
of O
rice B-CROP
, O
and O
rice B-CROP
and O
yams B-CROP
are O
both O
monocots O
. O
This O
means O
we O
can O
apply O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
same O
principles O
to O
understand O
gene O
functions O
in O
yams B-CROP
using O
our O
knowledge O
of O
rice B-CROP
. O
Taken O
together O
, O
this O
means O
that O
we O
might O
not O
see O
immediate O
benefits O
, O
but O
I O
believe O
that O
within O
the O
next O
five O
or O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
this O
can O
have O
a O
large O
impact O
on O
increasing O

I O
think O
this O
is O
the O

Illumina B-ORG
has O
given O
a O

a O

very O
important O
to O
West B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
. O
With O
this O
grant O
and O
the O
publicity O
, O
already O
people O
are O
starting O
to O
understand O
that O

is O
its O

not O
the O

there O

At O

How O
  O
As O
we O
did O
60 B-DATE
- I-DATE
some I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
we O
may O
be O
switching O
over O
to O
a O
new O
species O
of O
banana B-CROP
. O
One O
common O
misconception O
about O
bananas B-CROP
is O
that O
they O
will O
certainly O
go O
extinct O
because O
they O
're O
a O
monoculture O
, O
or O
a O
single O
crop O
that O
has O
little O
to O
no O
genetic O
variation O
( O
Read O
: O
It O
only O
has O
one O
chance O
to O
survive O
, O
since O
there O
are O
n't O
genetic O
mutants O
that O
can O
fight O
it O
off O
) O
. O
But O
what O
needs O
to O
be O
specified O
is O
that O
bananas B-CROP
are O
not O
a O
monoculture O
; O
Cavendish B-CROP
bananas B-CROP
, O
or O
the O
strain O
of O
bananas B-CROP
we O
are O
used O
to O
, O
are O
a O
monoculture O
. O
  O
" O
What O
you O
have O
to O
distinguish O
, O
" O
Peter O
said O
, O
" O
is O
that O
what O
we O
have O
commercially O
represents O
a O
very O
strong O
monoculture O
because O
everyone O
expects O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
Cavendish B-CROP
. O
Bananas B-CROP
come O
in O
blue O
, O
orange O
, O
and O
red O
and O
all O
different O
sizes O
— O
but O
they O
're O
not O
commercially O
available O
or O
viable O
at O
this O
time O
because O
they O
're O
blocked O
by O
people O
's O
perceptions O
of O
what O
bananas B-CROP
should O
be O
. O
" O
If O
we O
can O
get O
past O
the O
social O
construct O
of O
perfect O
, O
spotless O
yellow O
bananas B-CROP
, O
we O
'll O
be O
able O
to O
tap O
into O
other O
species O
of O
bananas B-CROP
, O
which O
are O
widely O
diverse O
. O
  O
Randy O
agrees O
: O
" O
Part O
of O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
people O
are O
addicted O
to O
the O
Cavendish B-CROP
. O
It O
's O
a O
crummy O
banana B-CROP
that O
's O
easy O
to O
produce O
in O
large O
volumes O
, O
exporters O
know O
how O
to O
ship O
it O
, O
and O
people O
like O
the O
way O
it O
looks O
, O
so O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
get O
away O
from O
. O
" O
  O
The O
takeaway O
? O
People O
will O
need O
to O
grow O
more O
open O
to O
alternative O
species O
of O
bananas B-CROP
. O
According O
to O
Peter O
, O
" O
Ultimately O
, O
the O
spread O
of O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
will O
introduce O
different O
varietals O
to O
the O
American B-GPE
public O
, O
which O
will O
come O
down O
to O
a O
difficult O
marketing O
challenge O
in O
convincing O
Americans B-PATHOGEN
that O
a O
brown O
- O
spotted O
banana B-CROP
is O
a O
good O
banana O
. O
" O
Randy O
compared O
this O
challenge O
to O
what O
's O
happened O
with O
apples B-CROP
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
half I-DATE
- I-DATE
century I-DATE
: O
" O
Apples B-CROP
today O
are O
much O
more O
diverse O
than O
the O
red O
and O
yellows O
we O
only O
used O
to O
see O
, O
so O
if O
people O
develop O
a O
taste O
for O
something O
besides O
Cavendish B-CROP
, O
that O
would O
be O
a O
move O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
— O
but O
the O
initial O
key O
thing O
is O
getting O
something O
resistant O
. O
" O
  O
Randy O
said O
that O
today B-DATE
, O
" O
the O
best O
thing O
that O
's O
available O
now O
is O
a O
series O
of O
Cavendish B-CROP
- O
like O
fruits B-PLANT_PART
coming O
out O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
that O
have O
a O
tolerance O
to O
the O
disease O
, O
but O
still O
are O
n't O
full O

blown O
resistant O
. O
But O
you O
have O
to O
replant O
them O
after O
two O
cycles O
, O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
pack O
well O
— O
so O
they O
're O
still O
problematic O
. O
" O
The O
only O
sure O
thing O
is O
that O
bananas B-CROP
as O
we O
know O
them O
will O
change O

Ton O
de O
Leeuw O
has O
done O
some O
research O
into O
growing O
sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
. O
  O
" O
My O
project O
stalled O
, O
partly O
because O
of O
the O
pandemic O
, O
and O
I O
lost O
the O
little O
bit O
I O
'd O
done O
in O
Morocco B-GPE
. O
That O
does O
n't O
mean O
I O
've O
been O
completely O
idle O
. O
My O
network O
has O
grown O
and O
become O
more O
interesting O
. O
Several O
companies O
and O
organizations O
approached O
me O
for O
information O
and O
possible O
cooperation O
. O
But O
, O
for O
whatever O
reason O
, O
nothing O
came O
of O
that O
. O
" O
  O
" O
I O
've O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
consider O
sweet B-CROP
potato I-CROP
farming O
in O
Morocco B-GPE
. O
I O
'm O
still O
convinced O
that O
country O
is O
the O
future O
of O
sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
. O
But O
you O
have O
to O
be O
there O
yourself O
and O
have O
enough O
independent O
financing O
, O
I O
learned O
from O
Karel O
van O
Oers O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
heed O
him O
very O
well O
. O
I O
started O
with O
insufficient O
, O
borrowed O
money O
. O
I O
did O
learn O
a O
lot O
and O
achieved O
a O
few O
things O
, O
" O
says O
Ton O
. O
  O
" O
For O
example O
, O
I O
put O
together O
a O
small O
team O
of O
very O
involved O
, O
knowledgeable O
people O
, O
which O
still O
exists O
. O
I O
also O
discovered O
the O
most O
interesting O
areas O
in O
Morocco B-GPE
. O
That O
country O
's O
big O
advantage O
is O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
, O
or O
hardly O
, O
rains O
in O
areas O
with O
the O
right O
temperatures O
, O
which O
sounds O
strange O
. O
" O
  O
" O
But O
you O
can O
drip O
irrigate O
much O
more O
precisely O
, O
giving O
the O
correct O
amount O
of O
water O
and O
nutrients O
at O
the O
times O
when O
the O
plant O
needs O
it O
. O
And O
thus O
, O
you O
have O
a O
far O
greater O
influence O
on O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
difference O
between O
first O

, O
" O

the O

  O
" O

, O
in O

The O
correct O
temperatures O

a O

The O
lack O

means O
that O

it O

undertook O
experiments O
in O

in O
several O
sweetpotato B-CROP

. O
They O
began O
by O
dividing O
each O

into O
two O
genetically O
different O
groups O
based O
on O
sequencing O
data O
, O
then O
crossed O
individuals O

to O
identify O

combinations O
that O
produce O
the O
advantage O
of O

. O
An O
important O
component O
of O
the O
approach O
is O
" O
reciprocal O

, O
" O
through O
which O

  O

take O
a O

them O

called O

The O

acts O
a O

It O
injects O
a O
little O
chunk O

Plantain B-CROP
banana I-CROP
is O
one O
of O
the O
staple O
foods O
of O
the O
African B-LOC
continent O
, O
but O
there O
are O
many O
reasons O
why O
it O
is O
unprofitable O
to O
grow O
plantain B-CROP
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
. O
  O
Plantains B-CROP
are O
fruits B-PLANT_PART
that O
are O
similar O
to O
bananas B-CROP
, O
but O
they O
have O
more O
starch O
and O
a O
thicker O
skin O
. O
They O
are O
also O
eaten O
in O
many O
forms O
and O
are O
nutrient O

  O
Though O
plantains B-CROP
are O
similar O
to O
bananas B-CROP
and O
Africa B-LOC
, O
as O
a O
whole O
, O
produces O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
world O

banana B-CROP
and O
plantain B-CROP
fruits B-PLANT_PART
, O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
does O
not O
grow O
plantains B-CROP
. O
The O
main O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
that O
diseases O
, O
pests O
, O
and O
sub O
- O
par O
conditions O
mean O
that O
planting O
plantains B-CROP
is O
not O
profitable O
enough O
for O
the O
country O
. O
  O
What O
are O
plantains B-CROP
used O
for O
? O
  O
Plantains B-CROP
have O
a O
bit O
more O
starch O
than O
bananas B-CROP
and O
are O
a O
bit O
longer O
and O
firmer O
than O
bananas B-CROP
. O
Although O
plantains B-CROP
are O
not O
as O
sweet O
as O
bananas B-CROP
, O
they O
are O
often O
enjoyed O
in O
their O
fresh O
, O
fruity O
form O
or O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
other O
forms O
like O
puree O
, O
flour O
, O

, O

, O
relishes O
or O

, O

, O
vinegar O
, O
and O
even O
wine O
. O
Plantain B-CROP
is O
also O
enjoyed O
in O
both O
unripe O
and O
ripe O
form O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
an O
incredibly O
versatile O
addition O
to O

. O
  O
Bananas B-CROP
and O
plantains B-CROP
constitute O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
staple O
food O
sources O
in O
Africa B-LOC
. O
Within O
Africa B-LOC
, O
the O
countries O
that O
produce O
the O
most O
plantains B-CROP
are O
Ghana B-GPE
, O
Nigeria B-GPE
, O
Cote B-GPE
d'Ivoire I-GPE
, O
and O
Guinea B-GPE
  O
Why O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
does O
not O
grow O
plantain B-CROP
banana B-CROP
  O
Even O
though O
Africa B-LOC

as O
a O
whole O
, O
is O
responsible O
for O
over O
a O
third O
of O
the O
world O
's O
banana B-CROP
and O
plantain B-CROP
production O
, O
plantains B-CROP
are O
not O
produced O
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
, O
specifically O
. O
Bananas B-CROP
and O
plantains B-CROP
are O
quite O
important O
crops O
in O
the O
African B-GPE
continent O
, O
especially O
because O
these O
fruits B-PLANT_PART
are O
nutrient O
- O
dense O
, O
with O
high O
quantities O
of O
carbohydrates O
. O
The O
Southern B-LOC
part I-LOC
of O
Africa B-LOC
produces O
over O
20 O
million O
tons O
of O
bananas B-CROP
and O
plantains B-CROP
annually O
. O
  O
However O
, O
only O
about O
one O
percent O
of O
this O
total O
amount O
is O
exported O
to O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
. O
Thus O
, O
even O
though O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
is O
part O
of O
the O
few O
countries O
that O
export O
their O
bananas B-CROP
, O
plantains B-CROP
are O
not O
exported O
because O
they O
are O
not O
grown O
within O
the O
country O
. O
  O
There O
are O
many O
reasons O
why O
plantains B-CROP
are O
not O
being O
produced O
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
, O
but O
the O
overarching O
reason O
is O
seemingly O
that O
it O
is O
just O
not O
profitable O
enough O
to O
grow O
them O
. O
Plantains B-CROP
are O
often O
grown O
in O
small O
family O
- O
type O
farm O
operations O
which O
means O
that O
these O
farms O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
produce O
and O
sell O
enough O
plantains B-CROP
to O
justify O
the O
costs O
of O
the O
plantation O
. O
  O
There O
are O
also O
other O
reasons O
why O
growing O
plantains B-CROP
in O
South B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
is O
unfeasible O
, O
including O
diseases O
, O
pests O
, O
and O
abiotic O
stress O
that O
could O
come O
with O
growing O
them O
. O
  O
Why O
diseases O
make O
growing O
plantain B-CROP
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
difficult O
  O
One O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
why O
it O
is O
difficult O
for O
farmers O
to O
grow O
plantains B-CROP
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
is O
the O
number O
of O
diseases O
that O
are O
found O
in O
the O
country O
and O
that O
were O
likely O
introduced O
by O
other O
infected O
plants O
. O
Diseases O
caused O
by O
fungus O
such O
as O
black B-DISEASE
Sigatoka I-DISEASE
and O
yellow B-DISEASE
Sigatoka I-DISEASE
result O
in O
early B-SYMPTOM
leaf I-SYMPTOM
death I-SYMPTOM
and O
lower B-SYMPTOM
yields I-SYMPTOM
, O
with O
crop O
losses O
caused O
by O
these O
diseases O
being O
as O
high O
as O
75 O
percent O
. O
  O
There O
are O
also O
diseases O
such O
as O
Banana B-PATHOGEN
Bunchy I-PATHOGEN
Top I-PATHOGEN
Virus I-PATHOGEN
that O
can O
spread O
quickly O
through O
a O
plantation O
, O
and O
Banana B-PATHOGEN
Streak I-PATHOGEN
Virus I-PATHOGEN
, O
which O
is O
embedded O
in O
a O
plant O
's O
genome O
and O
can O
not O
be O
spread O
. O
  O
The O
prevalence O
of O
these O
diseases O
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
means O
it O
may O
be O
too O
much O
of O
a O
risk O
for O
farmers O
to O
plant O
plantains B-CROP
, O
as O
they O
risk O
losing O
a O
large O
percentage O
of O
their O
investment O
to O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
diseases O
. O
  O
Why O
pests O
make O
growing O
plantain B-CROP
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
difficult O
  O
Additionally O
to O
the O
prevalence O
of O
several O
diseases O
, O
there O
are O
also O
pests O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
crop O
loss O
, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
plantains B-CROP
are O
not O
grown O
in O
South B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
. O
  O
Here O
, O
the O
banana O
weevil O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
insect O
pests O
in O
banana B-CROP
and O
plantain B-CROP
plantations O
in O
Africa B-LOC
. O
When O
a O
plantation O
is O
infected O
with O
banana O
weevil O
, O
the O
plantain B-CROP
crops O
have O
considerably O
less O
yield O
, O
which O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
leads O
to O
less O
sales O
and O
income O
for O
the O
farm O
. O
  O
Why O
abiotic O
stress O
makes O
growing O
plantain B-CROP
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
difficult O
  O
Bananas B-CROP
and O
plantains B-CROP
are O
tropical O
crops O
which O
means O
that O
they O
need O
high O
humidity O
, O
constant O
high O
temperatures O
, O
and O
high O
levels O
of O
rainfall O
to O
grow O
at O
their O
optimal O
potential O
. O
However O
, O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
has O
a O
sub B-LOC
- I-LOC
tropical I-LOC
climate O
, O
meaning O
that O
plantains B-CROP
will O
not O
have O
ideal O
conditions O
to O
grow O
in O
the O
country O
. O
Growing O
them O
could O
lead O
to O
sub O
- O
standard O
crops O
that O
do O
not O
sell O
well O
or O
sell O
and O
are O
not O
profitable O
enough O
to O
sustain O
the O
plantation O
and O
workers O
on O
it O
. O
  O
There O
are O
also O
factors O
like O
drought O
, O
wind O
, O
chilling O
, O
and O
nutritional O
deficiencies O
that O
farmers O
need O
to O
consider O
before O
they O
plant O
plantains B-CROP
, O
and O
these O
may O
be O
contributing O
factors O
to O
why O
many O
farmers O
decide O
not O
to O
plant O
them O

the O

not O
only O
the O

also O
the O

In O

in O
a O

But O
perhaps O
this O
crisis O
is O
a O
warning O
that O
we O
are O
growing O
our O
food O
in O
an O
unsustainable O
way O
and O
we O
will O
need O
to O
look O
to O
more O
radical O

for O
a O
permanent O
solution O
. O
  O
To O
understand O
how O
we O
got O
here O
, O
we O
need O
to O
take O
a O
look O
back O
at O
the O
history O
of O
the O
banana B-CROP
, O
and O
in O
particular O
the O
middle O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
when O
a O
crisis O
that O
had O
been O
growing O
for O
decades O
was O
threatening O
to O
bring O
down O
whole O
economies O
and O
leave O
thousands O
destitute O
. O
The O
banana B-CROP
was O
dying O
out O
. O
  O
A O
condition O
known O
as O
Fusarium B-DISEASE
wilt I-DISEASE
or O
Panama B-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
was O
wiping O
out O
whole O
plantations O
in O
the O
world O
's O
major O
banana B-CROP
- O
producing O
countries O
of O
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
. O
It O
threatened O
an O
industry O
so O
important O
to O
this O
part O
of O
the O
world O
that O
some O
states O
had O
became O
known O
as O
banana B-CROP
republics O
because O
they O
were O
virtually O
governed O
by O
the O
corporations O
that O
produced O
the O
crop O
. O
  O
Because O
bananas B-CROP
of O
the O
same O
type O
are O
virtually O
genetically O
identical O
, O
if O
one O
plant O
becomes O
infected O
, O
all O
of O
the O
other O
trees O
in O
a O
plantation O
are O
also O
susceptible O
. O
This O
meant O
it O
was O
only O
too O
easy O
for O
Panama B-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
to O
sweep O
through O
huge O
expanses O
of O
vulnerable O
host O
plants O
. O
In O
many O
areas O
, O
all O
of O
the O

were O
killed O

  O
Without O
a O
cure O
or O
treatment O
, O
there O
was O
no O
way O
back O
for O
a O

the O

taken O

For O
a O
while O

the O

from O

But O
this O
act O

only O
postponed O
the O
inevitable O

Soon O
these O
areas O

too O

Estimates O
vary O

What O
's O
surprising O
about O
the O
distribution O
of O
these O
banana B-CROP
plants O
to O
every O
part O
of O
the O
world O
hot O
enough O
for O
them O
to O
grow O
is O
that O
they O
're O
sterile O
. O
Wild B-CROP
bananas I-CROP
are O
filled O
with O
large O
hard O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
, O
which O
makes O
them O
hard O
to O
eat O
. O
Modern O
bananas B-CROP
ca O
n't O
even O
grow O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
. O
But O
far O
from O
hindering O
their O
spread O
, O
this O
genetic O
quirk O
is O
what O
has O
made O
bananas B-CROP
such O
a O
desirable O
crop O
. O
And O
what O
has O
left O
them O
so O
vulnerable O
. O
  O
Modern B-CROP
banana I-CROP
and O
plantain B-CROP
plants O
are O
what O
is O
known O
as O
" O
triploid O
" O
, O
meaning O
they O
have O
three O
copies O
of O
each O
of O
the O
chromosomes O
that O
carry O
their O
genes O
. O
As O
such O
, O
they O
can O
not O
reproduce O
sexually O
because O
their O
chromosomes O
can O
not O
be O
equally O
divided O
to O
create O
a O
sex O
cell O
, O
as O
happens O
in O
" O
diploid O
" O
organisms O
that O
have O
two O
copies O
of O
each O
chromosome O
( O
such O
as O
humans O
, O
most O
animals O
, O
and O
many O
plants O
) O
. O
  O
Triploids O
like O
this O
can O
arise O
when O
there O
is O
a O
malfunction O
in O
the O
process O
of O
forming O
sex O
cells O
in O
diploid O
organisms O
. O
Occasionally O
cells O
are O
produced O
that O
have O
two O
copies O
of O
each O
chromosome O
instead O
of O
one O
. O
When O
these O
fuse O
with O
a O
normal O
sex O
cell O
, O
the O
new O
plant O
has O
two O
chromosomes O
from O
one O
parent O
and O
one O
from O
the O
other O
, O
preventing O
it O
from O
making O
viable O
sex O
cells O
of O
its O
own O
. O
In O
the O
banana B-CROP
's O
case O
, O
the O
plant O
still O
produces O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
but O
ca O
n't O
make O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
. O
  O
On O
the O
surface O
this O
may O
appear O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
, O
but O
plants O
are O
not O
completely O
dependent O
on O
sexual O
reproduction O
. O
As O
any O
gardener O
knows O
, O
new O
plants O
can O
be O
started O
from O
cuttings O
, O
and O
new O
banana B-CROP
trees O
are O
usually O
produced O
from O
an O
existing O
plant O
by O
replanting O
root B-PLANT_PART
stalks I-PLANT_PART
, O
known O
as O
rhizomes B-PLANT_PART
, O
or O
shoots B-PLANT_PART
called O
suckers B-PLANT_PART
that O
grow O
out O
of O
them O
. O
  O
The O
prehistoric O
peoples O
who O
domesticated O
bananas B-CROP
and O
plantains B-CROP
can O
not O
have O
known O
anything O
about O
chromosome O
numbers O
. O
But O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
many O
varieties O
that O
they O
grew O
are O
triploid O
. O
So O
they O
must O
have O
learned O
to O
look O
out O
for O
these O
fortunate O
accidents O
and O
cultivate O
them O
, O
preferring O
them O
to O
their O
wild O
and O
seedy O
relations O
. O
  O
This O
has O
important O
consequences O
, O
both O
good O
and O
bad O
. O
Plants O
from O
cuttings B-PLANT_PART
are O
clones O
of O
one O
another O
and O
, O
give O
or O
take O
the O
odd O
mutation O
, O
are O
genetically O
identical O
. O
This O
removes O
variety O
and O
chance O
from O
the O
equation O
. O
Obviously O
we O
only O
plant O
copies O
of O
trees O
that O
are O
vigorous O
and O
produce O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
that O
we O
like O
, O
and O
all O
of O
the O
new O
trees O
will O
be O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
as O
the O
one O
we O
took O
cuttings O
from O
. O
  O
This O
is O
great O
for O
production O
on O
an O
industrial O
scale O
because O
the O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
are O
consistent O
and O
if O
you O
harvest O
and O
treat O
them O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
they O
will O
all O
be O
ripe O
and O
ready O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
Unfortunately O
it O
is O
also O
great O
for O
any O
disease O
that O
infects O
them O
because O
if O
it O
gets O
a O
foothold O
in O
one O
tree O
, O
those O
nearby O
will O
also O
be O
vulnerable O
, O
as O
will O
their O
neighbors O
, O
and O
it O
can O
spread O
through O
the O
whole O
plantation O
. O
Which O
is O
exactly O
what O
is O
happening O
now O
. O

The O
earliest O
known O
discovery O
of O
Panama B-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
was O
actually O
in O
Australia B-GPE
in O
1874 B-DATE
. O
First O
the B-SYMPTOM
leaves I-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
banana I-SYMPTOM
trees I-SYMPTOM
stopped I-SYMPTOM
growing I-SYMPTOM
. O
Then O
they O
started O
to O
curl B-SYMPTOM
and O
wilt B-SYMPTOM
. O
Eventually O
the B-SYMPTOM
trees I-SYMPTOM
dried I-SYMPTOM
out I-SYMPTOM
completely I-SYMPTOM
and I-SYMPTOM
died I-SYMPTOM
. O
In O
1890 B-DATE
, O
the O
disease O
was O
found O
in O
its O
namesake O
country O
and O
over O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
spread O
to O
most O
Caribbean B-LOC
and O
Central B-LOC
American I-LOC
countries O
. O
  O
It O
took O
a O
while O
to O
identify O
the O
cause O
, O
but O
in O
1910 B-DATE
, O
it O
was O
found O
to O
be O
the O
wilt B-PATHOGEN
fungus I-PATHOGEN
Fusarium B-PATHOGEN
oxysporum I-PATHOGEN
cubense I-PATHOGEN
or O
" O
Foc B-PATHOGEN
" O
for O
short O
. O
The O
plants O
died O
because O
the O
channels O
that O
carry O
water O
and O
minerals O
from O
the O
roots B-PLANT_PART
to O
the O
leaves B-PLANT_PART
became O
blocked O
. O
It O
was O
initially O
thought O
that O
these O
conduits O
became O
clogged O
by O
the O
fungus O
but O
we O
now O
know O
that O
the O
plant O
itself O
plugs O
them O
, O
presumably O
in O
a O
vain O
attempt O
to O
stop O
the O
fungus O
spreading O
. O
  O
We O
also O
now O
know O
that O
Foc B-PATHOGEN
is O
spread O
by O
contaminated O
soil O
. O
A O
minute O
amount O
of O
tainted O
soil O
can O
carry O
the O
disease O
to O
a O
new O
plantation O
where O
it O
remains O
infectious O
for O
decades O
, O
immune O
to O
any O
chemical O
treatments O
. O
This O
was O
the O
situation O
facing O
the O
banana B-CROP
industry O
in O
the B-DATE
1950s I-DATE
, O
when O
Gros B-CROP
Michel I-CROP
plantations O
around O
the O
world O
were O
being O
overwhelmed O
. O
  O
Cavendish B-CROP
bananas I-CROP
require O
more O
protection O
than O
Gros B-CROP
Michel I-CROP
, O
and O
were O
thought O
of O
as O
small O
and O
flavourless O
in O
comparison O
. O
But O
given O
the O
Cavendish B-CROP
's O
apparent O
immunity O
to O
Foc B-PATHOGEN
, O
and O
otherwise O
facing O
total O
collapse O
, O
the O
industry O
had O
no O
alternative O
but O
to O
switch O
. O
  O
For O
a O
while O
, O
it O
looked O
as O
if O
the O
banana B-CROP
had O
been O
saved O
. O
Then O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
late I-DATE
1960s I-DATE
, O
another O
outbreak O
of O
Panama B-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
was O
discovered O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
this O
time O
in O
a O
plantation O
of O
Cavendish B-CROP
plants O
. O
By O
the B-DATE
early I-DATE
2000s I-DATE
, O
only O
6,000 O
hectares O
of O
banana B-CROP
plantations O
out O
of O
a O
former O
50,000 O
hectares O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
remained O
. O
  O
This O
puzzling O
development O
was O
down O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
just O
as O
there O
are O
different O
varieties O
of O
bananas B-CROP
, O
there O
are O
different O
types O
of O
Foc B-PATHOGEN
. O
The O
Gros B-CROP
Michel I-CROP
trees O
were O
infected O
by O
what O
is O
known O
as O
" O
Race B-PATHOGEN
1 I-PATHOGEN
" O
. O
The O
strain O
of O
fungus O
that O
appeared O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
known O
as O
" O
Tropical B-PATHOGEN
Race I-PATHOGEN
4 I-PATHOGEN
" O
or O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
. O
It O
can O
infect O
not O
just O
Gros B-CROP
Michel I-CROP
, O
but O
also O
Cavendish B-CROP
bananas I-CROP
and O
as O
many O
as O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
varieties O
in O
cultivation O
. O
( O
Although O
this O
assumes O
that O
plantains B-CROP
are O
also O
susceptible O
and O
so O
far O
there O
is O
little O
conclusive O
evidence O
either O
way O
. O
) O
So O
now O
the O
industry O
is O
once O
again O
facing O
disaster O
, O
what O
can O
be O
done O
to O
save O
it O
this O
time O
? O
  O
A O
genetic O
solution O
? O
  O
The O
simplest O
response O
is O
quarantine O
. O
Panama B-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
was O
so O
devastating O
in O
the B-DATE
20th I-DATE
century I-DATE
because O
effective O
measures O
to O
control O
its O
spread O
came O
too O
late O
. O
It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
the O
first O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
outbreak O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
could O
have O
been O
nipped O
in O
the O
bud O
if O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
problem O
had O
been O
recognized O
earlier O
. O
But O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
innate O
resistance O
of O
Cavendish B-CROP
plants O
to O
Race B-PATHOGEN
1 I-PATHOGEN
encouraged O
complacency O
until O
the O
epidemic O
was O
out O
of O
control O
. O
  O
Can O
we O
stop O
the O
spread O
by O
preventing O
infected O
plant O
material O
and O
soil O
reaching O
new O
areas O
? O
Unfortunately O
, O
it O
's O
not O
necessarily O
that O
easy O
. O
Foc B-PATHOGEN
can O
lurk O
in O
minute O
patches O
of O
mud O
on O
a O
wheel O
or O
shoe O
. O
People O
, O
machinery O
and O
everything O
else O
coming O
into O
a O
plantation O
have O
to O
be O
stringently O
controlled O
. O
Imagine O

essentially O
a O

  O
It O

unprotected O
banana B-CROP
plants O
growing O
wild O
or O
in O
villages O
and O
if O
these O
become O
infected O
they O
can O
act O
as O
bridges O
for O
the O
disease O
to O
cross O
from O
one O
plantation O
to O
the O
next O
. O
Quarantine O
may O
slow O
the O
march O
of O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
, O
but O
in O
the O
long O
term O
we O
really O
need O
a O
banana B-CROP
that O
is O
resistant O
to O
the O
fungus O
. O
  O
Here O
, O
the O
triploid O
nature O
of O
the O
banana B-CROP
presents O
an O
unwanted O
complication O
. O
Historically O
, O
new O
crop O
varieties O
were O
bred O
by O
crossing O
plants O
with O
desired O
characteristics O
until O
they O
were O
combined O
in O
a O
single O
new O
variety O
. O
For O
example O
, O
cross O
breeding O
a O
plant O
that O
produces O
a O
good O
yield O
for O
farmers O
with O
another O
that O
was O
disease O
resistant O
. O
But O
crossing O
domesticated O
bananas B-CROP
does O
n't O
produce O
any O
seed B-PLANT_PART
and O
so O
this O
is O
not O
usually O
an O
option O
. O
  O
However O
, O
genetic O
modification O
offers O
other O
ways O
to O
move O
properties O
between O
plants O
( O
and O
other O
organisms O
) O
. O
In O
principle O
this O
could O
offer O
a O
solution O
and O
there O
are O
already O
some O
promising O
results O
. O
Researchers O
in O
Australia B-GPE
have O
found O
that O
adding O
two O
different O
genes O
to O
the O
genetic O
code O
of O
Cavendish B-CROP
bananas I-CROP
protects O
the O
plants O
from O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
. O
The O
first O
was O
taken O
from O
a O
wild B-CROP
banana I-CROP
resistant O
to O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
and O
is O
one O
of O
a O
large O
family O
of O
genes O
that O
recognize O
invading O
diseases O
so O
that O
the O
plants O
can O
protect O
themselves O
. O
  O
The O
second O
comes O
from O
a O
more O
unlikely O
source O
: O
nematode O
worms O
. O
There O
are O
occasions O
when O
organisms O
need O
some O
cells O
to O
sacrifice O
themselves O
. O
A O
dramatic O
example O
is O
when O
a O
tree O
sheds O
its O
leaves B-PLANT_PART
for O
winter B-DATE
but O
it O
happens O
in O
our O
own O
development O
too O
. O
In O
the O
womb O
, O
your O
fingers O
are O
formed O
from O
flipper O
like O
appendages O
when O
the O
cells O
that O
separate O
them O
die O
off O
. O
The O
nematode O
gene O
is O
one O
that O
blocks O
this O
process O
. O
  O
This O
seems O
a O
strange O
way O
to O
protect O
the O
plant O
but O
it O
might O
be O
effective O
against O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
in O
bananas B-CROP
because O
, O
as O
we O
saw O
earlier O
, O
the O
invading O
fungus O
may O
actually O
hijack O
this O
process O
, O
using O
chemical O
messages O
to O
program O
the O
banana B-CROP
cells O
to O
self O
destruct O
. O
The O
nematode O
gene O
may O
work O
by O
blocking O
these O
signals O
. O
  O
Using O
these O
methods O
, O
we O
could O
carry O
on O
eating O
the O
bananas B-CROP
that O
we O
are O
used O
to O
or O
even O
see O
if O
the O
same O
would O
work O
to O
help O
bring O
back O
the O
tastier O
Gros B-CROP
Michel I-CROP
. O
But O
these O
resistant O
Cavendish B-CROP
bananas B-CROP
are O
now O
GM O
crops O
. O
People O
in O
many O
countries O
have O
become O
used O
to O
eating O
GM O
food O
, O
but O
not O
so O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
which O
has O
the O
most O
stringent O
GM O
regulations O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Perhaps O
European B-LOC
regulators O
could O
be O
persuaded O
to O
make O
an O
exception O
if O
it O
was O
a O
case O
of O
GM O
bananas B-CROP
or O
none O
at O
all O
. O
But O
we O
might O
need O
to O
look O
for O
another O
solution O
. O
  O
Chromosome O
math O
  O
One O
alternative O
could O
be O
to O
make O
new O
triploid O
seedless O
plants O
from O
scratch O
. O
Picking O
out O
the O
occasional O
tree O
that O
produced O
seedless O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
must O
have O
been O
a O
slow O
process O
when O
bananas B-CROP
were O
first O
domesticated O
. O
But O
now O
that O
we O
understand O
the O
process O
, O
we O
can O
make O
our O
own O
triploid O
plants O
much O
more O
easily O
. O
  O
This O
is O
usually O
done O
using O
plants O
with O
four O
copies O
of O
each O
type O
of O
chromosome O
called O
tetraploids O
. O
These O
often O
grow O
faster O
and O
produce O
sturdier O
plants O
that O
can O
withstand O
stress O
better O
than O
their O
diploid O
relations O
( O
many O
of O
our O
crops O
have O
expanded O
chromosome O
numbers O
) O
. O
But O
they O
are O
especially O
useful O
in O
plant O
breeding O
because O
they O
produce O
sex O
cells O
with O
two O
copies O
of O
each O
chromosome O
. O
This O
allows O
the O
creation O
of O
otherwise O
impossible O
infertile O
hybrids O
. O
  O
When O
you O
cross O
a O
tetraploid O
( O
with O
two O
copies O
of O
every O
chromosome O
in O
each O
sex O
cell O
) O
with O
a O
normal O
diploid O
plant O
( O
with O
only O
one O
copy O
of O
each O
chromosome O
per O
sex O
cell O
) O

you O
get O
a O
triploid O
. O
A O
triploid O
plant O
ca O
n't O
produce O
its O
own O
sex O
cells O
. O
So O
if O
it O
is O
a O
banana B-CROP
, O
its O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
will O
be O
seedless O
. O
  O
The O
same O
result O
can O
be O
achieved O
by O
taking O
an O
infertile O
cross O
between O
species O
, O
the O
plant O
equivalent O
of O
a O
mule O
, O
and O
exposing O
it O
to O
chemicals O
that O
cause O
it O
to O
double O
its O
chromosomes O
and O
become O
tetraploid O
. O
A O
hardy O
hybrid O
of O
wheat B-CROP
and O
rye B-CROP
called O
triticale O
was O
made O
in O
this O
way O
. O
  O
Some O
breeding O
programs O
have O
made O
tetraploid O
plants O
by O
crossing O
triploid O
and O
diploid O
varieties O
, O
but O
this O
depends O
on O
infrequent O
genetic O
events O
and O
so O
it O
takes O
time O
and O
effort O
. O
A O
quicker O
way O
is O
to O
force O
chromosomes O
to O
double O
using O
a O
chemical O
called O
colchicine O
. O
  O
From O
these O
approaches O
we O
now O
have O
a O
number O
of O
tetraploid O
synthetic O
banana B-CROP
hybrids O
and O
some O
have O
proved O
to O
be O
resistant O
to O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
. O
These O
plants O
are O
not O
very O
useful O
commercially O
because O
they O
are O
fertile O
so O
produce O
seed B-PLANT_PART
- O
filled O
bananas B-CROP
. O
But O
they O
can O
be O
crossed O
with O
one O
another O
to O
bring O
together O
useful O
traits O
, O
and O
then O
with O
ordinary O
diploid O
trees O
to O
make O
a O
new O
generation O
of O
triploid O
seedless O
bananas B-CROP
. O
This O
approach O
has O
also O
created O
some O
new O
hybrids O
with O
resistance O
to O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
, O
but O
none O
so O
far O
with O
the O
flavor O
and O
consistency O
that O
we O
want O
in O
a O
replacement O
for O
Cavendish B-CROP
. O
  O
A O
slightly O
more O
radical O
approach O
is O
to O
try O
to O
evolve O
plants O
resistant O
to O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
. O
Cavendish B-CROP
plants O
are O
clones O
but O
their O
genetic O
code O
can O
become O
slightly O
different O
over O
time O
because O
of O
mutations O
and O
changes O
in O
the O
way O
their O
DNA O
is O
read O
. O
  O
One O
group O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
been O
exposing O
Cavendish B-CROP
banana I-CROP
seedlings B-PLANT_PART
to O
soil O
contaminated O
with O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
and O
looking O
for O
those O
that O
survive O
a O
little O
bit O
better O
than O
the O
others O
. O
They O
pick O
these O
out O
and O
use O
them O
for O
their O
next O
trial O
. O
Only O
two O
or O
three O
plants O
of O
every O
10,000 O
show O
promise O
but O
after O
many O
iterations O
they O
now O
have O
a O
Cavendish B-CROP
line O
with O
some O
ability O
to O
withstand O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
. O
  O
However O
, O
none O
of O
these O
potential O
solutions O
deal O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
farming O
huge O
plantations O
of O
cloned O
trees O
is O
an O
intrinsically O
unstable O
way O
of O
doing O
things O
. O
They O
may O
offer O
economies O
of O
scale O
, O
keeping O
prices O
down O
and O
offering O
consistent O
tasty O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
. O
But O
, O
even O
with O
a O
solution O
to O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
, O
how O
long O
will O
it O
be O
before O
the O
next O
disease O
takes O
hold O
? O
  O
Perhaps O
we O
should O
be O
using O
more O
varieties O
of O
bananas B-CROP
and O
growing O
them O
alongside O
other O
crops O
or O
in O
alternation O
with O
them O
. O
That O
way O
, O
an O
infection O
wo O
n't O
find O
such O
huge O
swathes O
of O
susceptible O
hosts O
close O
together O
, O
as O
can O
happen O
now O
. O
  O
There O
is O
also O
evidence O
that O
some O
other O
crops O
can O
protect O
bananas B-CROP
against O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
. O
One O
study O
found O
that O
bananas B-CROP
planted O
in O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
- O
contaminated O
soils O
largely O
escaped O
infection O
after O
being O
grown O
in O
the O
same O
fields O
as O
Chinese B-CROP
leeks I-CROP
for O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O
This O
seems O
to O
be O
because O
Chinese B-CROP
leeks I-CROP
release O
chemicals O
that O
kill O
fungi O
. O
Cassava B-CROP
also O
clears O
fields O
of O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
anti O
- O
fungal O
substances O
produced O
by O
the O
cassava B-CROP
itself O
and O
by O
microorganisms O
associated O
with O
its O
roots B-PLANT_PART
. O
  O
The O
Cavendish B-CROP
banana I-CROP
may O
have O
had O
a O
remarkable O
journey O
from O
colonial O
curiosity O
to O
global O
staple O
. O
But O
its O
success O
has O
helped O
create O
a O
food O
system O
with O
a O
fatal O
flaw O
( O
though O
this O
problem O
of O
monoculture O
farming O
is O
hardly O
unique O
to O
bananas B-CROP
) O
. O
Perhaps O
we O
ultimately O
need O
to O
be O
prepared O
to O
accept O
less O
standardized O
and O
slightly O
more O
expensive O
food O
in O
order O
to O
accommodate O
less O
intense O
and O
more O
diverse O
agriculture O
. O
You O
might O
never O
be O
quite O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
when O
you O
peel O
a O
banana B-CROP
, O
but O
the O
result O
could O
be O
a O
more O
robust O
and O
sustainable O
food O
system O
without O
a O
major O
crisis O
every B-DATE

Previous O
studies O

documented O
CBSV B-PATHOGEN

more O
devastating O
than O
UCBSV B-PATHOGEN
. O
This O
is O
because O
CBSV B-PATHOGEN

in O

We O
set O
out O

characterize O
the O
CBSV B-PATHOGEN

whole O

from O
the O
26 O

In O

we O
report O

Using O

produced O
the O

of O
both O

This O
new O

led O
to O
the O
finding O
that O
CBSV B-PATHOGEN
has O
a O
faster O
rate O

The O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
have O
discovered O
that O
for O

, O
rates O
of O
nonsynonomous O
substitutions O
are O
more O

All O
comparative O

CBSV B-PATHOGEN

outsmarting O

Food O

view O
of O
the O

: O
  O
Monoculture O
— O
growing O
vast O
fields O
of O
the O
same O
crop O
year O
after O
year O
— O
is O
probably O
the O
single O
most O
powerful O
simplification O
of O
modern O
agriculture O
. O
But O
monoculture O
is O
poorly O
fitted O
to O
the O
way O
nature O
seems O
to O
work O
. O
Very O
simply O
, O
a O
field O
of O
identical O
plants O
will O
be O
exquisitely O
vulnerable O
to O
insects O
, O
weeds O
and O
disease O
. O
Monoculture O
is O
at O
the O
root O
of O
virtually O
every O
problem O
that O
bedevils O
the O
modern O
farmer O
, O
and O
that O
virtually O
every O
input O
has O
been O
designed O

  O
Pollan O
is O
adamantly O
opposed O

a O

: O
  O
Biotechnology O
is O
the O
new O
silver O
bullet O
that O
will O
save O
monoculture O

But O
a O
new O
silver O
bullet O
is O
not O
a O
new O
paradigm O
— O
rather O
, O
it O
's O
something O
that O
will O
allow O
the O
old O
paradigm O
to O
survive O
. O
  O
Since O

this O
in O
1998 B-DATE

the O
undeniable O
problems O
posed O
by O

have O
put O
forward O
as O
an O
against O

Let O
's O
look O
a O
little O
closer O
. O
  O
Is O
monoculture O
synonymous O
with O
GE O
crops O
? O
  O
Because O
two O
of O
the O
most O
popular O
genetically O
engineered O
foods O
are O
commodity O
crops O
– O
corn B-CROP
and O
soybeans B-CROP

many O

Michael O

promote O
the O
belief O
that O

are O
identical O

But O
few O
experts O
agree O
with O
this O
assessment O

however O

There O
is O
no O
necessary O
link O

the O

( O

Over O
the O

The O
increasing O
availability O
of O
databases O
containing O
both O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
( O
MRI O
) O
and O
genetic O
data O
allows O
researchers O
to O
utilize O
multimodal O
data O
to O
better O
understand O
the O
characteristics O
of O
dementia O
of O

. O
  O
OBJECTIVE O
  O
The O
goal O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
develop O
and O
analyze O
novel O
biomarkers O
that O
can O
help O
predict O
the O
development O
and O

of O
DAT O
. O
  O
METHODS O
  O
We O
used O
feature O
selection O
and O
ensemble O
learning O
classifier O
to O
develop O
an O
image O
/ O
genotype O
- O
based O
DAT O
score O
that O
represents O
a O
subject O
's O
likelihood O
of O
developing O
DAT O
in O
the O
future O
. O
Three O
feature O
types O
were O
used O
: O
MRI O
only O
, O
genetic O
only O
, O
and O
combined O
multimodal O
data O
. O
We O
used O
a O
novel O
data O
stratification O
method O
to O
better O
represent O
different O
stages O
of O
DAT O
. O
Using O
a O
pre O
- O
defined O
0.5 O
threshold O
on O
DAT O
scores O
, O
we O
predicted O
whether O
a O
subject O
would O
develop O
DAT O
in O
the O
future O

  O
RESULTS O
  O
Our O
results O
on O

can O
better O
characterize O
subjects O
with O

( O
Accuracy O
= O
0.614 O
) O
compared O
to O

  O
CONCLUSION O
  O
MRI O
and O
genetic O
data O
can O
contribute O
to O
DAT O
prediction O
in O
different O
ways O
. O
MRI O
data O
reflects O
anatomical O
changes O
in O
the O

while O
genetic O
data O
can O
detect O
the O
risk O
of O

  O
You O
might O
also O
discourage O

by O
rotating O
sweet B-CROP

you O

As O
for O
the O

there O
is O
a O

called O

" O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
that O
's O
the O
exact O
problem O
you O
're O
having O
, O
but O
it O
's O
one O
of O
the O
things O
that O
can O
rot B-SYMPTOM
a I-SYMPTOM
harvested I-SYMPTOM
onion B-CROP
. O
  O
Switching O
varieties O
is O
one O
way O
to O
work O
around O
a O
repeat O
of O
this O
one O
as O
well O
as O
not O
over O
- O
fertilizing O
with O
nitrogen O
fertilizer O
and O
avoiding O
spraying O
your O

with O

water O
. O
Use O
drip O

or O
water O
the O

, O
not O
the O
leaves B-PLANT_PART
. O
  O
A O
few O
other O
fungal B-DISEASE
diseases I-DISEASE
and O
issues O
can O
also O
rot B-SYMPTOM
an I-SYMPTOM
onion I-SYMPTOM
. O
Poor O
drainage O
and/or O
excess O
water O
is O
a O
common O
denominator O
of O
most O
of O
them O
, O
so O
improving O
the O
soil O
quality O
and/or O
reducing O
water O
might O
help O
. O
  O
As O
you O
mentioned O
, O
harvesting O
too O
late O
in O
the O
season O
is O
a O
possibility O
, O
too O
. O
Once O
the O
leaves B-PLANT_PART
flop O
and O
brown O
, O
that O
's O
the O
time O
to O
pull O
onions B-CROP
. O
Some O
growers O
even O
intentionally O
knock O
over O
the O
leaves B-PLANT_PART
once O
a O
majority O
of O
them O
begin O
to O
flop O
to O
encourage O
the O
plants O
to O
go O
into O
dormancy O
and O
turn O
brown O
. O
  O
Yet O
another O
possibility O
is O
that O
some O
onion B-CROP
varieties O
try O
to O
send O
up O
lots O
of O
seed B-PLANT_PART
stalks B-PLANT_PART
. O
Ones O
trying O
to O
go O
to O
seed B-DISEASE
often I-DISEASE
rot I-DISEASE
and O
are O
n't O
ideal O
for O
long O
storage O
. O
Even O
if O
you O
clip O
off O
the O
flowering O
stalk O
ASAP O
, O
those O
onions B-CROP
tend O
to O
rot O
faster O
than O
non O
- O
flowering O
ones O
. O
  O
The O
solution O
to O
that O
is O
to O
eat O
flower B-PLANT_PART
- O
producing O
onions O
fresh O
and O
dry O
and O
save O
the O
non O
- O
flowering O
ones O
for O
storage O
. O
  O
Finally O
, O
onion O
maggots O
can O
bore O
into O
onions B-CROP
and O
cause O
rotting B-SYMPTOM
. O
You O
'd O
most O

Abstract O
Potato B-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
management O
plays O
a O
valuable O
role O
in O
the O
agriculture O
field O
as O
it O
might O
cause O
a O
significant O
loss O
in O

. O
Therefore O
, O
timely O
recognition O
and O
classification O
of O
potato B-DISEASE
leaves I-DISEASE
diseases I-DISEASE
are O
necessary O
to O
minimize O
the O
loss O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
time O
taking O

and O
requires O
human O
efforts O
. O
Thus O
, O
an O
accurate O
automated O
technique O
for O
timely O
detection O
and O
classification O
is O
needed O
to O
cope O
with O
the O
aforementioned O
challenges O
. O
There O
exist O
techniques O
grounded O
on O
machine O

and O
deep O

Therefore O
, O
this O

proposes O
a O
technique O

on O
an O

that O
uses O

a O
few O

  O
To O
get O
more O
suckers B-PLANT_PART
, O
he O

a O
nursery O

would O
uproot O
the O

cut O
it O
into O
two O
equal O

of O
the O
four O
parts O
has O
meristems B-PLANT_PART
, O
which O
are O
decapitated O
by O
peeling O
it O
off O
. O
Removing O
the O
meristems B-PLANT_PART
allows O
multiple O
buds O
around O

stump O
to O
germinate O
, O
producing O
many O
suckers B-PLANT_PART
when O
slightly O
buried O
in O

soil O
. O
  O
The O

added O
that O
the O
stumps B-PLANT_PART
are O
disinfected O
by O
dipping O
them O
into O
a O
soluble O
fungicide O
solution O
for O
about O
15 B-DATE
to I-DATE
20 I-DATE
minutes I-DATE
. O
This O
would O
, O
he O
explained O
, O
get O
rid O

on O
the O

and O
would O
in O
the O
long O
run O
produce O
healthy O

vigorous O
suckers B-PLANT_PART
that O
would O
also O
mean O
better O

. O
  O
The O
organic O

Abstract O
Early B-DISEASE
blight I-DISEASE
is O
a O
disease O
of O
potato B-CROP
that O
is O
caused O
by O
Alternaria B-PATHOGEN
species I-PATHOGEN
, O
notably O
A. B-PATHOGEN
solani I-PATHOGEN
. O
The O
disease O
is O
usually O
controlled O
with O
fungicides O
. O
However O
, O
A. B-PATHOGEN
solani I-PATHOGEN
is O
developing O
resistance O
against O
fungicides O
, O
and O
potato B-CROP
cultivars O
with O
genetic O
resistance O
to O
early B-DISEASE
blight I-DISEASE
are O
currently O
not O
available O
. O
Here O
, O
we O
identify O
two O
wild B-CROP
potato I-CROP
species O
, O
which O
are O
both O
crossable O
with O
cultivated O
potato B-CROP
( O
Solanum B-CROP
tuberosum I-CROP
) O
, O
that O
show O
promising O
resistance O
against O
early B-DISEASE
blight I-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
. O
The O
cross O
between O
resistant O
S. B-CROP
berthaultii I-CROP
and O
a O
susceptible O
diploid O
S. B-CROP
tuberosum I-CROP
gave O
rise O
to O
a O
population O
in O
which O
resistance O
was O
inherited O
quantitatively O
. O
S. B-CROP
commersonii I-CROP
subsp O
. O
malmeanum O
was O
also O
crossed O
with O
diploid O
S. B-CROP
tuberosum I-CROP
, O
despite O
a O
differing O
endosperm O
balance O
number O
. O
This O
cross O
resulted O
in O
triploid O
progeny O
in O
which O
resistance O
was O
inherited O
dominantly O
. O
This O
is O
somewhat O
surprising O
, O
as O
resistance O
against O
necrotrophic O
plant O
pathogens O
is O
usually O
a O

trait O

invented O
the O

standard O

The O
first O
step O
is O
to O
gather O
as O

as O
possible O
from O
the O
chosen O
male O

and O
use O
it O
to O
fertilize O

Next O
comes O
a O
fouror O
five O
- O
month O
wait O
for O
the O
plants O
to O
produce O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
. O
Then O
the O
bananas B-CROP
are O
harvested O
, O
peeled O
by O
hand O
and O
pressed O
through O
a O
sieve O
. O
A O
ton O
of O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
might O
yield O
a O
handful O
of O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
, O
less O
than O
half O
of O
which O
will O
germinate O
naturally O

After O
the O
precious O

seedlings O
are O
planted O
comes O
another O

Finally O

up B-DATE

after O
the O
initial O

  O
Rowe O

The O

Only O
after O

Because O
there O

no O

in O
African B-LOC
varieties O
to O
provide O
complete O
protection O
against O
the O

, O
we O
searched O

not O
become O

These O
findings O

We O
used O

cassava B-PATHOGEN

virus I-PATHOGEN
in O
cassava B-CROP
germplasm O
lines O
that O
were O
highly O

( O

or O
that O
restricted O
virus O
infections O
to O
stems B-PLANT_PART
and O
roots B-PLANT_PART
only O
( O
DSC O
260 O
) O
. O
We O
show O
that O
the O
resistance O
in O
those O
lines O
is O
not O
a O
restriction O
of O
long O

distance O
movement O
but O
due O
to O
preventing O
virus O
unloading O
from O
the O
phloem B-PLANT_PART
into O
parenchyma B-PLANT_PART
cells O
for O
replication O
, O
thus O
restricting O
the O
virus O
to O
the O
phloem B-PLANT_PART
cells O
only O
. O
When O
DSC O
167 O
and O
DSC O
260 O
were O
compared O
for O
virus O
invasion O
, O
only O
a O
low O
CBSV B-PATHOGEN
signal O
was O
found O
in O
phloem B-PLANT_PART
tissue O
of O
DSC O
167 O
, O
indicating O
that O
there O
is O
no O
replication O
in O
this O
host O
, O
while O
the O
presence O
of O
intense O
hybridization O
signals O
in O
the O
phloem O
of O
DSC O
260 O
provided O
evidence O
for O
virus O
replication O
in O
companion O
cells O
. O
In O
neither O
of O
the O
two O
lines O
studied O
was O
there O
evidence O

replication O
outside O
the O
phloem B-PLANT_PART

. O
Thus O
, O
we O
conclude O
that O
in O
resistant O
cassava B-CROP
lines O
, O
CBSV B-PATHOGEN
is O
confined O
to O
the O
phloem B-PLANT_PART

only O

  O
Currently O
, O
he O

because O

, O
the O

have O
risen O
but O

Persaud O
said O
he O
stopped O
planting O
some O

Persaud O
, O
he O
now O
concentrates O
on O

though O
the O
lack O
of O

is O
also O
a O
problem O
. O
This O
situation O
, O
he O
said O
, O
results O
in O
thick O
bushes O
growing O
around O
the O
coconuts B-CROP
since O
there O
is O
no O
one O
to O
weed O
them O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
plants O
die O
, O
he O
said O
. O
" O
You O

Cozier O
also O
runs O
a O

" O
Sometimes O
we O

most O
of O
the O

" O
He O

in O
the O
Pomeroon B-LOC

a O

lamented O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O

But O
some O
also O
expressed O
the O
opinion O
that O

there O
could O
be O
a O

Despite O

Given O

that O

This O
led O
me O
to O
a O

to O
my O
surprise O
I O
found O
that O
using O
banana B-CROP
peels O
as O
a O
component O
of O

is O
becoming O
a O
popular O
topic O
. O
I've O
learned O
that O
if O
banana B-CROP
skins O
are O
cooked O
with O
onions B-CROP
, O
garlic B-CROP

barbecue O
sauce O
, O
they O

" O
pulled O
not O

, O
" O
as O
some O
like O
to O
call O
it O
) O
, O
and O
that O
banana B-CROP
peels O
can O
also O
be O
made O
into O
an O
alternative O
for O
bacon O
. O
Banana B-CROP
skins O
can O
be O
pureed O
to O
use O
in O
baked O
goods O
to O
punch O
up O
flavor O
( O
think O
banana B-CROP
bread O

If O

be O
sure O

most O

of O
all O
( O

the O

Banana B-CROP

one O
of O
the O
most O
consumed O
fruits B-PLANT_PART

also O
a O
staple O
in O
many O

. O
Sustaining O
banana B-CROP

is O
important O
to O
supply O
domestic O
and O
international O
markets O
, O
which O
support O
the O
livelihood O
of O

The O
most O

and O

currently O
devastated O
by O
one O
of O
the O
most O
threatening O
plant O
diseases O
in O
history O
called O
Fusarium B-DISEASE

or O
Panama B-DISEASE

The O

Therefore O
, O
more O

Indonesia B-GPE

Generally O

the O

malaccensis I-CROP
, O
which O
was O
found O
to O

the O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN

This O
gene O

, O
was O
transplanted O
into O
the O
genome O
of O
the O
Cavendish B-CROP
banana I-CROP
by O
a O
technique O
known O
as O
transgenesis O
. O
The O
result O
was O
a O
genetically O

organism O
( O
GMO O

– O
the O

The O
GMO O
status O
of O
the O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN

resistant O
Cavendish B-CROP
plant O
means O
that O
these O
bananas B-CROP
can O
not O

, O
be O
commercialised O
. O
Importantly O
in O
this O
instance O
, O
the O
Cavendish B-CROP

so O
there O
is O
no O

could O
end O

  O
Since O

the O

called O
CRISPR O
( O

which O
could O
help O
prevent O
millions O

being O
destroyed O
in O

. O
  O
The O
CRISPR O
technique O
was O
discovered O
in O
the O
mid-2000s O
and O
involves O
making O
tiny O

For O

, O
it O

delete O

deactivate O
a O
single O

In O
this O
way O
, O
CRISPR O
does O
not O
involve O
the O
introduction O
of O

I O
went O

Since O

I O

all O

  O
You O

a O

If O
they O
are O
given O
the O
chance O

they O

I O

  O
How O
do O

As O

I O
realized O
that O
for O

we O
need O
a O

But O
the O
original O
challenge O
still O
holds O
. O
After O

the O

there O
should O
be O
a O

This O

not O

I O

  O
What O

do O
you O
want O

  O
I O
am O
working O
on O
two O
sets O
of O
genes O
. O
One O
set O
of O
genes O
are O
called O
Cell O
Wall O
Invertase O
Inhibitors O
. O
These O
genes O
regulate O
sucrose O
transport O
in O
plants O
. O
If O
you O
can O
knock O
out O
or O
maybe O
reduce O
the O
expression O
of O
these O
genes O
, O
there O
will O
be O
more O
sucrose O
transported O
into O
the O
roots B-PLANT_PART
of O
the O
sweet B-CROP

and O
stored O
as O

That O
could O
increase O
the O
yield O
. O
  O
The O
other O
set O
are O
Beta O
Carotene O
Hydroxylase O
genes O
. O
When O
plants O
produce O
beta O
carotene O
, O
they O
also O
convert O
the O
beta O
carotene O
into O
other O
downstream O
products O
with O
the O
help O
of O
these O
genes O
. O
If O
you O
can O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
conversion O
, O
then O
the O
beta O

will O
stay O
in O
the O

  O
In O
Ghana B-GPE

in O
most O

  O
How O

my O

developing O

system O
to O
deliver O
what O
I O
constructed O

Right O
now O
, O
my O
aim O
is O
to O
train O

We O
could O
apply O

biofortify O
some O
of O
the O
staple O
food O
crops O
to O
increase O
iron O
content O
in O
these O

Many O
of O
our O
staple O

need O
genetic O
improvement O

There O
are O
so O
many O

out O
there O
that O
we O
can O

to O
improve O
such O

  O
What O

Maybe O
it O
will O
take O
some O

It O
will O
take O

it O

  O
How O

It O
is O
time O

It O
offers O
several O
advantages O
over O
traditional O
methods O

Firstly O
, O
it O
is O
non O

destructive O
, O
meaning O
it O
does O

harm O
the O
plant O
, O
which O
can O
continue O

and O
produce O
potatoes B-CROP
. O
Additionally O
, O
this O
new O
method O
is O
more O
efficient O
and O
accurate O
, O
taking O
only B-DATE

of O
over O
90 O
% O
. O
The O
potential O
applications O
of O
the O
DRS O
method O
go O
beyond O
detecting O
late B-DISEASE
blight I-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
in O
potato B-CROP
crops O
. O
The O
researchers O
suggest O
that O
it O
could O
be O
adapted O
for O
other O
crops O
and O
diseases O
, O
allowing O
farmers O
to O
identify O
and O
respond O
to O
various O
plant O
health O
threats O
quickly O
. O
Additionally O
, O
the O
DRS O
method O
could O
be O
used O
for O
routine O
checks O
and O
monitoring O
of O
potato B-CROP
crops O
for O

disease I-DISEASE
and O
rapidly O
screening O
potato B-CROP
varieties O
for O
resistance O

the O
disease O
. O
This O
would O
help O
farmers O
to O
choose O
types O
that O
are O
less O
susceptible O
to O
infection O
and O
ultimately O
improve O
crop O
yields O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
it O
reduces O
economic O
losses O
due O
to O
plant O
disease O
. O
Portable O
DRS O
has O
a O
significant O
potential O
to O
be O
used O
as O
a O
tool O
for O
rapid O

destructive O
detection O
of O
plant O

, O
with O
broad O
implications O
for O
the O
agricultural O
industry O
. O
Additionally O
, O
the O
device O
is O
portable O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
making O
it O
ideal O
for O
on O

site O
testing O
. O
Farmers O
can O
quickly O
and O
accurately O
identify O
the O
disease O
without O
sending O

Consequently O
, O
it O

who O
may O
not O

However O
, O
our O

revealed O
unexpected O
variation O
of O
eBSV B-PATHOGEN
amplification O
in O
calibrator O

composed O
of O

Our O
in O

suggest O
that O
this O

is O
due O
to O
the O

followed O
by O

We O
also O
present O
evidence O
that O
accumulation O
of O
viral O
transcripts O
in O
AAB O

is O
downregulated O
both O
at O

Finally O
, O
we O
recommend O
that O
such O

Differences O

the O

The O
strongest O
effects O

were O
most O

in O
the O

, O
which O
also O
had O
the O

Seasonal O
differences O
were O
a O
key O

of O

cultivation O
yields O
genetically O

each O

  O
To O
understand O
why O
banana B-CROP
breeding O
is O
difficult O
, O
it O
helps O
to O
compare O
genomes O
. O
The O
human O
genome O
is O
bundled O
up O
into O
chromosomes O

and O
all O
our O

have O
two O

copies O

is O
just O
one O
process O

Sperm O

cells O
only O
get O
one O
copy O
of O

chromosome O
( O

) O
, O
so O
that O
when O
they O
combine O
, O
voila O
: O
our O

have O
the O

number O
as O
their O
parents O

Most O

  O
However O
, O
occasionally O
something O
goes O
wrong O
. O
Some O
parental O
banana B-CROP

fail O
to O
divide O
their O

two O

the O
