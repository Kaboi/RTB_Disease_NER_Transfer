really O

Well O
, O
they O

and O
they O

. O
  O
Bananas B-CROP
are O
both O
a O
fruit B-PLANT_PART

not O
a O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
. O
While O
the O
banana B-CROP
plant O
is O
colloquially O
called O
a O
banana B-CROP
tree O
, O
it O
's O
actually O
an O
herb O
distantly O
related O
to O
ginger B-CROP
, O
since O
the O
plant O
has O
a O
succulent O
tree O
stem B-PLANT_PART
, O
instead O
of O
a O
wood O
one O
. O
  O
The O
yellow O
thing O
you O
peel O
and O
eat O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
because O
it O
contains O
the O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
of O
the O
plant O
. O
Although O
since O
bananas B-CROP
have O
been O
commercially O

, O
the O
plants O
are O
sterile O
, O
and O
the O
seeds B-PLANT_PART

gradually O
been O
reduced O
to O
little O

  O
And O
to O

more O
banana B-CROP

: O
bananas B-CROP
grow O
in O
what O
are O
known O
as O
" O
hands O

called O
because O
of O
their O
appearance O

to O
successfully O
grow O

tree O
in O
the O
Netherlands B-GPE

theorized O

  O
Linnaeus O
took O
his O

for O

further O
by O
speculating O

the O

Nutritionists O
debate O
the O

of O
the O

  O
Despite O
their O
popularity O
, O
there O
is O
debate O
among O
nutritionists O
about O
the O
actual O
health O
value O
of O
the O
banana B-CROP
. O
  O
While O
it O
's O
true O
bananas B-CROP
are O
generally O
low O
in O
calories O
( O
one O
medium O
banana B-CROP
has O
about O
100 O
) O
, O
and O
they O
have O
little O
to O
no O
fat O
, O
sodium O
or O
cholesterol O

are O
a O
good O
source O
of O
vitamin O

, O
potassium O

and O
vitamin O
B6 O
, O
they O
also O
contain O
about O
27 O
grams O
of O
carbohydrates O
and O
14 O
grams O
of O
sugar O
. O
  O
Many O
nutritionists O
argue O
the O
problem O
with O
carbs O
is O
that O
they O
turn O
to O
sugar O
once O
they O
reach O
the O
blood O
stream O
, O
spiking O
your O
blood O
sugar O
levels O
, O
leaving O
you O
vulnerable O
to O
cravings O

eventual O
weight O

, O
which O
is O
why O
some O
nutritionists O
would O
recommend O
snacking O
on O
other O
fruits B-PLANT_PART

  O
Still O
, O
medical O
research O
( O
which O
is O
oft O
disproved O

that O

When O

IbBBX24 O
regulates O

  O
But O
let O

back O
up O
for O
a O

Why O
do O
we O

so O
much O
about O
sweet B-CROP

? O
  O
The O
debate O
about O

is O
, O
in O
a O
way O
, O
a O
debate O
about O
human O

( O
though O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
it O
's O
also O
definitely O
about O
the O

themselves O
) O
. O
Before O
Europeans O

much O
of O
the O

, O
native O
people O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the B-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
traveled O
fairly O
long O
distances O
across O
the O

South B-GPE
Americans I-GPE
made O
it O
all O
the O
way O
out O
to O
the B-LOC
Galapagos I-LOC
Islands I-LOC
, O
which O
are O
upwards O
of O
620 O

the O
myriad O

Those O

the O

New B-GPE

and O
Australia B-GPE
, O
are O
hundreds O

which O
means O
Pacific B-LOC
natives O
regularly O
ventured O
across O

to O

  O
All O
these O

clearly O

an O

for O
the O

But O
they O
also O
shared O
a O

They O

But O
... O
how O
? O
Sweet B-CROP

originate O
in O
South B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
thousands O
of O

from O
most O

  O
There O
are O
three O
basic O
ways O
this O
could O
be O
possible O
: O
  O
South B-LOC
Americans I-LOC
ventured O
over O
to O
Polynesia B-LOC
, O
bringing O
sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
with O
them O
. O
Native O
Polynesians O
then O
either O
deliberately O
cultivated O
this O
new O
crop O
, O
or O
the O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
accidentally O
got O
fertilized O
and O
sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
began O
to O
grow O
naturally O
. O
Polynesians O
traveled O
to O
South B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
then O
brought O
sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
back O
with O
them O
on O
their O
return O
trip O
, O
presumably O
with O
the O
intent O
to O
plant O
the O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
when O
they O
got O
home O
. O
Sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
, O
or O
just O
their O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
, O
floated O
from O
South B-LOC
America I-LOC
to O
Polynesia B-LOC
, O
no O
human O
action O
required O
. O
  O
Again O
: O
it O
's O
still O
not O
clear O
which O
of O
these O
is O
true O
, O
but O
archaeologists O
have O
used O
sweet B-CROP

as O
evidence O
to O
show O
that O
Polynesians B-LOC

Americans I-GPE
either O
definitely O

with O

  O
Apart O
from O

later O

) O
  O
One O
key O
puzzle O
piece O
: O
what O
words O
we O
use O
to O
identify O
the O
tuber B-PLANT_PART
. O
Since O
sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
definitely O
originated O
in O
South B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
researchers O
looked O
at O
the O
terms O
for O
the O
vegetable O
in O
use O
by O
native O
peoples O
, O
then O
examined O
how O
those O
terms O
compared O
to O
the O
words O
used O
in O

and O
East B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
. O
In O
South B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
for O
example O
, O
sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
are O
called O
kuala O
, O
kumara O
, O
cumal O
, O
and O
other O
words O
that O
bear O
a O
striking O
similarity O
to O
the O
terms O
used O
in O
much O
of O
the B-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
Islands I-LOC
: O
umala O
, O
kumala O
, O
kumara O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O
  O
Central B-LOC
Americans I-LOC
called O
them O
camote O
or O
camotil O
, O
which O
is O
nearly O
identical O
to O
the O
terms O
used O
in O
East B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
( O
kamote O
, O
camote O
) O
. O
In O
the O
Caribbean B-LOC
, O
sweet B-CROP
potatoes I-CROP
went O
by O
Spanish O
words O
: O
batata O
or O

, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
're O
called O
in O
New B-GPE
Guinea I-GPE
and O
nearby O

. O
  O
These O
linguistic O
differences O
do O
n't O
precisely O
mirror O
sweet B-CROP

introduction O
, O
since O
old O
names O
can O
continue O
to O
apply O
to O
new O
varieties O
( O
in O
other O
words O
, O
you O
might O
name O
a O
delicious O
new O
treat O
after O
something O
pretty O
similar O
you O
're O
more O
familiar O
with O
) O
, O
and O
we O
know O
that O
the O
tubers B-PLANT_PART
were O
actually O
brought O
west O
multiple O
times O
— O
European B-LOC
explorers O
definitely O
brought O
some O
over O

Infographic O
by O
Sara O
Chodosh O
  O
Regardless O
of O
how O
many O

there O
were O

these O

would O
all O
necessitate O
direct O

between O
native O

on O
either O
side O
of O
the B-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
. O
But O
not O
all O
researchers O
agree O
. O
Just O
because O
the O
words O
are O
similar O
does O
n't O
mean O
that O
the O

  O

branched O

Thus O

the O

  O

The O

  O
A O

It O
threatened O

that O
some O

because O

were O
virtually O
governed O
by O
the O

  O
Because O

the O

virtually O
genetically O
identical O
, O
if O
one O
plant O
becomes O
infected O
, O
all O
of O
the O

are O
also O
susceptible O

This O
meant O
it O
was O
only O
too O
easy O
for O

all O

about O

to O

hot O
enough O
for O

that O
they O
're O
sterile O

Wild B-CROP
bananas I-CROP

filled O

which O

Modern O

ca O

even O

But O
far O

this O
genetic O
quirk O
is O
what O
has O
made O
bananas B-CROP
such O
a O
desirable O
crop O

And O
what O
has O
left O
them O
so O
vulnerable O
. O
  O
Modern B-CROP
banana I-CROP
and O
plantain B-CROP
plants O
are O
what O
is O
known O
as O
" O
triploid O
" O
, O
meaning O
they O
have O
three O
copies O
of O
each O
of O
the O
chromosomes O
that O
carry O
their O
genes O
. O
As O
such O
, O
they O
can O
not O
reproduce O
sexually O
because O
their O
chromosomes O
can O
not O
be O
equally O
divided O
to O
create O
a O
sex O
cell O
, O
as O
happens O
in O
" O
diploid O
" O
organisms O
that O
have O
two O
copies O
of O
each O
chromosome O
( O
such O
as O
humans O
, O
most O
animals O
and O
many O
plants O
) O
. O
  O
Triploids O
like O
this O
can O
arise O
when O
there O
is O
a O
malfunction O
in O
the O
process O
of O
forming O
sex O
cells O
in O
diploid O
organisms O
. O
Occasionally O
cells O
are O
produced O
that O
have O
two O
copies O
of O
each O
chromosome O
instead O
of O
one O
. O
When O
these O
fuse O
with O
a O
normal O
sex O
cell O
, O
the O
new O
plant O
has O
two O
chromosomes O
from O
one O
parent O
and O
one O
from O
the O
other O
, O
preventing O
it O
from O
making O
viable O
sex O
cells O
of O
its O
own O
. O
In O
the O
banana B-CROP
's O
case O
, O
the O
plant O
still O
produces O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
but O
ca O
n't O
make O
seeds B-PLANT_PART
. O
  O
On O
the O
surface O
this O
may O
appear O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
, O
but O
plants O
are O
not O
completely O
dependent O
on O
sexual O
reproduction O
. O
As O
any O
gardener O
knows O
, O
new O
plants O
can O
be O
started O
from O
cuttings O
, O
and O
new O
banana B-CROP
trees O
are O
usually O
produced O
from O
an O
existing O
plant O
by O
replanting O
root B-PLANT_PART
stalks I-PLANT_PART
, O
known O
as O
rhizomes B-PLANT_PART
, O
or O
shoots B-PLANT_PART
called O
suckers B-PLANT_PART
that O
grow O
out O
of O
them O
. O
  O
The O
prehistoric O
peoples O
who O
domesticated O
bananas B-CROP
and O
plantains B-CROP
can O
not O
have O
known O
anything O
about O
chromosome O
numbers O
. O
But O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
many O
varieties O
that O
they O
grew O
are O
triploid O
. O
So O
they O
must O
have O
learned O
to O
look O
out O
for O
these O
fortunate O
accidents O
and O
cultivate O
them O
, O
preferring O
them O
to O
their O
wild O
and O
seedy O

. O
  O
This O
has O
important O

both O
good O

take O
the O
odd O
mutation O
, O
are O
genetically O
identical O
. O
This O
removes O
variety O
and O
chance O
from O
the O
equation O
. O
Obviously O
we O
only O
plant O
copies O
of O
trees O
that O
are O
vigorous O
and O
produce O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
that O
we O
like O
, O
and O
all O
of O
the O
new O
trees O
will O
be O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
as O
the O
one O
we O
took O
cuttings O
from O
. O
  O
This O
is O
great O
for O
production O
on O
an O
industrial O
scale O
because O
the O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
are O
consistent O
and O
if O
you O
harvest O
and O
treat O
them O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
they O
will O
all O
be O
ripe O
and O
ready O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
Unfortunately O
it O
is O
also O
great O
for O
any O
disease O
that O
infects O
them O
because O
if O
it O
gets O
a O
foothold O
in O
one O
tree O
, O
those O
nearby O
will O
also O
be O
vulnerable O
, O
as O
will O
their O
neighbours O
, O
and O
it O
can O
spread O
through O
the O
whole O
plantation O

Which O
is O
exactly O
what O

The O
earliest O
known O
discovery O
of O
Panama B-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
was O
actually O
in O
Australia B-GPE
in O
1874 B-DATE
. O
First O
the B-SYMPTOM
leaves I-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
banana I-SYMPTOM
trees I-SYMPTOM
stopped I-SYMPTOM
growing I-SYMPTOM
. O
Then O
they O
started O
to O
curl B-SYMPTOM
and I-SYMPTOM
wilt I-SYMPTOM
. O
Eventually O
the B-SYMPTOM
trees I-SYMPTOM
dried I-SYMPTOM
out I-SYMPTOM
completely I-SYMPTOM
and I-SYMPTOM
died I-SYMPTOM
. O
In O
1890 B-DATE
, O
the O
disease O
was O
found O
in O
its O
namesake O
country O
and O
over O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
spread O
to O
most O
Caribbean B-LOC
and O
Central B-LOC
American I-LOC
countries O
. O
  O
It O
took O
a O
while O
to O
identify O
the O
cause O
, O
but O
in O
1910 B-DATE
, O
it O
was O
found O
to O
be O
the O
wilt B-PATHOGEN
fungus I-PATHOGEN
Fusarium B-PATHOGEN
oxysporum I-PATHOGEN
cubense I-PATHOGEN
or O
" O
Foc B-PATHOGEN
" O
for O
short O
. O
The O
plants O
died O
because O
the O
channels O
that O
carry O
water O
and O
minerals O
from O
the O
roots B-PLANT_PART
to O
the O
leaves B-PLANT_PART
became O
blocked O
. O
It O
was O
initially O
thought O
that O
these O
conduits O
became O
clogged O
by O
the O
fungus O
but O
we O
now O
know O
that O
the O
plant O
itself O
plugs O
them O
, O
presumably O
in O
a O
vain O
attempt O
to O
stop O
the O
fungus O
spreading O
. O
  O
We O
also O
now O
know O
that O
Foc B-PATHOGEN
is O
spread O
by O
contaminated O
soil O
. O
A O
minute O
amount O
of O
tainted O
soil O
can O
carry O
the O
disease O
to O
a O
new O
plantation O
where O
it O
remains O
infectious O
for O
decades O
, O
immune O
to O
any O

This O
was O
the O
situation O
facing O
the O
banana B-CROP
industry O
in O
the B-DATE
1950s I-DATE
, O
when O
Gros B-CROP

  O
Cavendish B-CROP
bananas I-CROP
require O
more O

Gros B-CROP
Michel I-CROP
, O
and O
were O
thought O

as O
small O

But O
given O
the O

otherwise O
facing O
total O

the O

had O
no O

  O
For O
a O
while O

it O
looked O

Then O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
late I-DATE

another O

this O

By O
the B-DATE

This O
puzzling O
development O
was O
down O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
just O
as O
there O
are O
different O
varieties O

, O
there O
are O
different O
types O

The O

were O
infected O
by O
what O
is O
known O

The O

It O
can O

also O

as O
many O
as O
80 O

of O

( O
Although O
this O
assumes O
that O

are O
also O
susceptible O
and O
so O
far O
there O
is O
little O
conclusive O
evidence O
either O

So O
now O
the O

is O
once O
again O
facing O
disaster O
, O
what O
can O
be O
done O
to O
save O
it O
this O
time O
? O
  O
A O
genetic O
solution O
? O
  O
The O
simplest O
response O
is O
quarantine O
. O
Panama B-DISEASE
disease I-DISEASE
was O
so O
devastating O
in O
the B-DATE
20th I-DATE
century I-DATE
because O
effective O
measures O
to O
control O
its O
spread O
came O
too O
late O
. O
It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
the O
first O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
outbreak O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
could O
have O
been O
nipped O
in O
the O
bud O
if O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
problem O
had O
been O
recognised O
earlier O
. O
But O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
innate O
resistance O
of O
Cavendish B-CROP
plants O
to O
Race B-PATHOGEN
1 I-PATHOGEN
encouraged O
complacency O
until O
the O
epidemic O
was O
out O
of O
control O
. O
  O
Can O
we O
stop O
the O
spread O
by O
preventing O
infected O
plant O
material O
and O
soil O
reaching O
new O
areas O
? O
Unfortunately O
, O
it O
's O
not O
necessarily O
that O
easy O
. O
Foc B-PATHOGEN
can O
lurk O
in O
minute O
patches O
of O
mud O
on O
a O
wheel O
or O
shoe O
. O
People O
, O
machinery O
and O
everything O
else O
coming O
into O
a O
plantation O
have O
to O
be O
stringently O
controlled O
. O
Imagine O
operating O
what O
is O
essentially O
a O
farm O
with O
all O
non O
- O
essential O
people O
and O
vehicles O
excluded O
and O
with O
changing O
and O
decontamination O
zones O
for O
those O
you O
have O
to O
let O
in O
. O
  O
It O
worked O
for O
a O
while O
in O
Australia B-GPE
, O
which O
has O
very O
strict O
rules O
to O
prevent O
foreign O
soil O
entering O
the O
country O
, O
but O
even O
there O
the O
defences O
were O
breached O
in O
2015 B-DATE
. O
There O
are O
always O
slip O
ups O
, O
and O
people O
who O
ignore O
the O
rules O
. O
In O
many O
areas O
there O
are O
unprotected O
banana B-CROP
plants O
growing O
wild O
or O
in O
villages O
and O
if O
these O
become O
infected O
they O
can O
act O
as O
bridges O
for O
the O
disease O
to O
cross O
from O
one O
plantation O
to O
the O
next O
. O
Quarantine O
may O
slow O
the O
march O
of O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
, O
but O
in O
the O
long O
term O
we O
really O
need O
a O
banana B-CROP
that O
is O
resistant O
to O
the O
fungus O
. O
  O
Here O
, O
the O
triploid O
nature O
of O
the O
banana B-CROP
presents O
an O
unwanted O
complication O
. O
Historically O
, O
new O
crop O
varieties O
were O
bred O
by O
crossing O
plants O
with O
desired O
characteristics O
until O
they O
were O
combined O
in O
a O
single O
new O
variety O
. O
For O
example O
, O
cross O
breeding O
a O
plant O
that O
produces O
a O
good O
yield O
for O
farmers O
with O
another O
that O
was O
disease O
resistant O
. O
But O
crossing O
domesticated O
bananas B-CROP
does O
n't O
produce O
any O
seed B-PLANT_PART
and O
so O
this O
is O
not O
usually O
an O
option O
. O
  O
However O
, O
genetic O
modification O
offers O
other O
ways O
to O
move O
properties O
between O
plants O
( O
and O
other O
organisms O
) O
. O
In O
principle O
this O
could O
offer O
a O
solution O
and O
there O
are O
already O
some O
promising O
results O
. O
Researchers O
in O
Australia B-GPE
have O
found O
that O
adding O
two O
different O
genes O
to O
the O
genetic O
code O
of O
Cavendish B-CROP
bananas I-CROP
protects O
the O
plants O
from O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
. O
The O
first O
was O
taken O
from O
a O
wild B-CROP
banana I-CROP
resistant O
to O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
and O
is O
one O
of O
a O
large O
family O
of O
genes O
that O
recognise O
invading O
diseases O
so O
that O
the O
plants O
can O
protect O
themselves O
. O
  O
The O
second O
comes O
from O
a O
more O
unlikely O
source O
: O
nematode O
worms O
. O
There O
are O
occasions O
when O
organisms O
need O
some O
cells O
to O
sacrifice O
themselves O
. O
A O
dramatic O
example O
is O
when O
a O
tree O
sheds O
its O
leaves B-PLANT_PART
for O
winter B-DATE
but O
it O
happens O
in O
our O
own O
development O
too O
. O
In O
the O
womb O
, O
your O
fingers O
are O
formed O
from O
flipper O
like O
appendages O
when O
the O
cells O
that O
separate O
them O
die O
off O
. O
The O
nematode O
gene O
is O
one O
that O
blocks O
this O
process O
. O
  O
This O
seems O
a O
strange O
way O
to O
protect O
the O
plant O
but O
it O
might O
be O
effective O
against O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
in O
bananas B-CROP
because O
, O
as O
we O
saw O
earlier O
, O
the O
invading O
fungus O
may O
actually O
hijack O
this O
process O
, O
using O
chemical O
messages O
to O
programme O
the O
banana B-CROP
cells O
to O
self O
destruct O
. O
The O
nematode O
gene O
may O
work O
by O
blocking O
these O
signals O
. O
  O
Using O
these O
methods O
, O
we O
could O
carry O
on O
eating O
the O
bananas B-CROP
that O
we O
are O
used O
to O
or O
even O
see O
if O
the O
same O
would O
work O
to O
help O
bring O
back O
the O
tastier O
Gros B-CROP
Michel I-CROP
. O
But O
these O
resistant O
Cavendish B-CROP
bananas B-CROP
are O
now O
GM O
crops O
. O
People O
in O
many O
countries O
have O
become O
used O
to O
eating O
GM O
food O
, O
but O
not O
so O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
which O
has O
the O
most O
stringent O
GM O
regulations O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Perhaps O
European B-LOC
regulators O
could O
be O
persuaded O
to O
make O
an O
exception O
if O
it O
was O
a O
case O
of O
GM B-CROP
bananas I-CROP
or O
none O
at O
all O
. O
But O
we O
might O
need O
to O
look O
for O
another O
solution O
. O
  O
Chromosome O
maths O
  O
One O
alternative O
could O
be O
to O
make O
new O
triploid O
seedless O
plants O
from O
scratch O
. O
Picking O
out O
the O
occasional O
tree O
that O
produced O
seedless O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
must O
have O
been O
a O
slow O
process O
when O
bananas B-CROP
were O
first O
domesticated O
. O
But O
now O
that O
we O
understand O
the O
process O
, O
we O
can O
make O
our O
own O
triploid O
plants O
much O
more O
easily O
. O
  O
This O
is O
usually O
done O
using O
plants O
with O
four O
copies O
of O
each O
type O
of O
chromosome O
called O
tetraploids O
. O
These O
often O
grow O
faster O
and O
produce O
sturdier O
plants O
that O
can O
withstand O
stress O
better O
than O
their O
diploid O
relations O
( O
many O
of O
our O
crops O
have O
expanded O
chromosome O
numbers O
) O
. O
But O
they O
are O
especially O
useful O
in O
plant O
breeding O
because O
they O
produce O
sex O
cells O
with O
two O
copies O
of O
each O
chromosome O
. O
This O
allows O
the O
creation O
of O
otherwise O
impossible O
infertile O
hybrids O
. O
  O
When O
you O
cross O
a O
tetraploid O
( O
with O
two O
copies O
of O
every O
chromosome O
in O
each O
sex O
cell O
) O
with O
a O
normal O
diploid O
plant O
( O
with O
only O
one O
copy O
of O
each O
chromosome O
per O
sex O
cell O
) O
you O
get O
a O
triploid O
. O
A O
triploid O
plant O
ca O
n't O
produce O
its O
own O
sex O
cells O
. O
So O
if O
it O
is O
a O
banana B-CROP
, O
its O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
will O
be O
seedless O
. O
  O
The O
same O
result O
can O
be O
achieved O
by O
taking O
an O
infertile O
cross O
between O
species O
, O
the O
plant O
equivalent O
of O
a O
mule O
, O
and O
exposing O
it O
to O
chemicals O
that O
cause O
it O
to O
double O
its O
chromosomes O
and O
become O
tetraploid O
. O
A O
hardy O
hybrid O
of O
wheat B-CROP
and O
rye B-CROP
called O
triticale O
was O
made O
in O
this O
way O
. O
  O
Some O
breeding O
programmes O
have O
made O
tetraploid O
plants O
by O
crossing O
triploid O
and O
diploid O
varieties O
, O
but O
this O
depends O
on O
infrequent O
genetic O
events O
and O
so O
it O
takes O
time O
and O
effort O
. O
A O
quicker O
way O
is O
to O
force O
chromosomes O
to O
double O
using O
a O
chemical O
called O
colchicine O
. O
  O
From O
these O
approaches O
we O
now O
have O
a O
number O
of O
tetraploid O
synthetic O
banana B-CROP
hybrids O
and O
some O
have O
proved O
to O
be O
resistant O
to O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
. O
These O
plants O
are O
not O
very O
useful O
commercially O
because O
they O
are O
fertile O
so O
produce O
seed B-PLANT_PART
- O
filled O
bananas B-CROP
. O
But O
they O
can O
be O
crossed O
with O
one O
another O
to O
bring O
together O
useful O
traits O
, O
and O
then O
with O
ordinary O
diploid O
trees O
to O
make O
a O
new O
generation O
of O
triploid O
seedless O
bananas B-CROP
. O
This O
approach O
has O
also O
created O
some O
new O
hybrids O
with O
resistance O
to O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
, O
but O
none O
so O
far O
with O
the O
flavour O
and O
consistency O
that O
we O
want O
in O
a O
replacement O
for O
Cavendish B-CROP
. O
  O
A O
slightly O
more O
radical O
approach O
is O
to O
try O
to O
evolve O
plants O
resistant O
to O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
. O
Cavendish B-CROP
plants O
are O
clones O
but O
their O
genetic O
code O
can O
become O
slightly O
different O
over O
time O
because O
of O
mutations O
and O
changes O
in O
the O
way O
their O
DNA O
is O
read O
. O
  O
One O
group O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
been O
exposing O
Cavendish B-CROP
banana I-CROP
seedlings B-PLANT_PART
to O
soil O
contaminated O
with O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
and O
looking O
for O
those O
that O
survive O
a O
little O
bit O
better O
than O
the O
others O
. O
They O
pick O
these O
out O
and O
use O
them O
for O
their O
next O
trial O
. O
Only O
two O
or O
three O
plants O
of O
every O
10,000 O
show O
promise O
but O
after O
many O
iterations O
they O
now O
have O
a O
Cavendish B-CROP
line O
with O
some O
ability O
to O
withstand O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
. O
  O
However O
, O
none O
of O
these O
potential O
solutions O
deal O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
farming O
huge O
plantations O
of O
cloned O
trees O
is O
an O
intrinsically O
unstable O
way O
of O
doing O
things O
. O
They O
may O
offer O
economies O
of O
scale O
, O
keeping O
prices O
down O
and O
offering O
consistent O
tasty O
fruit B-PLANT_PART
. O
But O
, O
even O
with O
a O
solution O
to O
TR4 B-PATHOGEN
, O
how O
long O
will O
it O
be O
before O
the O
next O
disease O
takes O
hold O
? O
  O
Perhaps O
we O
should O
be O
using O
more O
varieties O
of O
bananas B-CROP
and O
growing O
them O
alongside O
other O
crops O
or O
in O
alternation O
with O
them O
. O
That O
way O
, O
an O
infection O
wo O
n't O
find O
such O
huge O
swathes O
of O

Cassava B-CROP
also O
clears O

perhaps O
because O

its O
