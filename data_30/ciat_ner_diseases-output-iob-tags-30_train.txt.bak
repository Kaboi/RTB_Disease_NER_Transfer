must	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
slow	O
process	O
when	O
bananas	B-CROP
were	O
first	O
domesticated	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
that	O
we	O
understand	O
the	O
process	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
make	O
our	O
own	O
triploid	O
plants	O
much	O
more	O
easily	O
.	O
 	O
This	O
is	O
usually	O
done	O
using	O
plants	O
with	O
four	O
copies	O
of	O
each	O
type	O
of	O
chromosome	O
called	O
tetraploids	O
.	O

These	O
often	O
grow	O
faster	O
and	O
produce	O
sturdier	O
plants	O
that	O
can	O
withstand	O
stress	O
better	O
than	O
their	O
diploid	O
relations	O
(	O
many	O
of	O
our	O
crops	O
have	O
expanded	O
chromosome	O
numbers	O
)	O
.	O
But	O
they	O
are	O
especially	O
useful	O
in	O
plant	O
breeding	O
because	O
they	O
produce	O
sex	O
cells	O
with	O
two	O
copies	O
of	O
each	O
chromosome	O
.	O

This	O
allows	O
the	O
creation	O
of	O
otherwise	O
impossible	O
infertile	O
hybrids	O
.	O
 	O
When	O
you	O
cross	O
a	O
tetraploid	O
(	O
with	O
two	O
copies	O
of	O
every	O
chromosome	O
in	O
each	O
sex	O

)	O
with	O
a	O
normal	O
diploid	O
plant	O
(	O
with	O
only	O
one	O
copy	O
of	O
each	O
chromosome	O
per	O
sex	O

)	O
you	O
get	O
a	O

A	O

So	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
banana	B-CROP
,	O
its	O
fruit	B-PLANT_PART
will	O
be	O
seedless	O

 	O
The	O

can	O
be	O

by	O
taking	O

the	O

to	O

that	O

A	O
hardy	O

this	O

 	O
Some	O

have	O
made	O
tetraploid	O
plants	O
by	O
crossing	O
triploid	O

diploid	O
varieties	O

but	O
this	O
depends	O
on	O
infrequent	O
genetic	O
events	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
takes	O
time	O
and	O
effort	O
.	O

A	O
quicker	O
way	O
is	O
to	O
force	O
chromosomes	O
to	O
double	O
using	O
a	O
chemical	O
called	O
colchicine	O

 	O
From	O
these	O
approaches	O
we	O
now	O
have	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
tetraploid	O
synthetic	O
banana	B-CROP
hybrids	O
and	O
some	O
have	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O

These	O
plants	O
are	O
not	O
very	O

commercially	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
fertile	O
so	O
produce	O

But	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
crossed	O

to	O
bring	O
together	O
useful	O

and	O
then	O
with	O

to	O
make	O
a	O
new	O

of	O
triploid	O

This	O

has	O
also	O

People	O

Perhaps	O
European	B-LOC
regulators	O
could	O
be	O
persuaded	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
exception	O
if	O
it	O

a	O
case	O
of	O
GM	O
bananas	B-CROP
or	O
none	O

we	O
might	O

to	O
look	O
for	O
another	O

 	O
Chromosome	O
math	O
 	O
One	O
alternative	O
could	O
be	O
to	O
make	O
new	O
triploid	O
seedless	O
plants	O
from	O
scratch	O
.	O
Picking	O
out	O
the	O
occasional	O
tree	O
that	O
produced	O
seedless	O
fruit	B-PLANT_PART
must	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
slow	O
process	O
when	O
bananas	B-CROP
were	O
first	O
domesticated	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
that	O
we	O
understand	O
the	O
process	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
make	O
our	O
own	O
triploid	O
plants	O
much	O
more	O
easily	O
.	O
 	O
This	O
is	O
usually	O
done	O
using	O
plants	O
with	O
four	O
copies	O
of	O
each	O
type	O
of	O
chromosome	O
called	O
tetraploids	O
.	O

These	O
often	O
grow	O
faster	O
and	O
produce	O
sturdier	O
plants	O
that	O
can	O
withstand	O
stress	O
better	O
than	O
their	O
diploid	O
relations	O
(	O
many	O
of	O
our	O
crops	O
have	O
expanded	O
chromosome	O
numbers	O
)	O
.	O
But	O
they	O
are	O
especially	O
useful	O
in	O
plant	O
breeding	O
because	O
they	O
produce	O
sex	O
cells	O
with	O
two	O
copies	O
of	O
each	O
chromosome	O
.	O

This	O
allows	O
the	O
creation	O
of	O
otherwise	O
impossible	O
infertile	O
hybrids	O
.	O
 	O
When	O
you	O
cross	O
a	O
tetraploid	O
(	O
with	O
two	O
copies	O
of	O
every	O
chromosome	O
in	O
each	O
sex	O
cell	O
)	O
with	O
a	O
normal	O
diploid	O
plant	O
(	O
with	O
only	O
one	O
copy	O
of	O
each	O
chromosome	O
per	O
sex	O
cell	O
)	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
triploid	O
.	O

A	O
triploid	O
plant	O
ca	O
n't	O

So	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
banana	B-CROP
,	O
its	O
fruit	B-PLANT_PART
will	O
be	O
seedless	O

 	O
The	O
same	O
result	O
can	O
be	O
achieved	O
by	O
taking	O
an	O
infertile	O

the	O
plant	O
equivalent	O
of	O
a	O

and	O
exposing	O
it	O
to	O
chemicals	O
that	O
cause	O
it	O
to	O
double	O

become	O

A	O
hardy	O
hybrid	O
of	O
wheat	B-CROP
and	O
rye	B-CROP
called	O
triticale	O
was	O
made	O
in	O
this	O
way	O

 	O
Some	O
breeding	O
programs	O
have	O
made	O
tetraploid	O
plants	O
by	O
crossing	O
triploid	O
and	O
diploid	O
varieties	O
,	O

but	O
this	O
depends	O
on	O
infrequent	O
genetic	O
events	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
takes	O
time	O
and	O
effort	O
.	O

A	O
quicker	O
way	O
is	O
to	O
force	O
chromosomes	O
to	O
double	O
using	O
a	O
chemical	O
called	O
colchicine	O
.	O
 	O
From	O
these	O
approaches	O
we	O
now	O
have	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
tetraploid	O
synthetic	O
banana	B-CROP
hybrids	O
and	O
some	O
have	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
resistant	O
to	O
TR4	B-PATHOGEN
.	O

These	O
plants	O
are	O
not	O
very	O
useful	O
commercially	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
fertile	O
so	O
produce	O
seed	B-PLANT_PART
-	O
filled	O
bananas	B-CROP

But	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
crossed	O
with	O
one	O
another	O
to	O
bring	O
together	O
useful	O
traits	O
,	O

and	O
then	O
with	O
ordinary	O
diploid	O
trees	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
new	O
generation	O
of	O
triploid	O
seedless	O
bananas	B-CROP
.	O

This	O
approach	O
has	O
also	O
created	O
some	O
new	O
hybrids	O
with	O
resistance	O
to	O
TR4	B-PATHOGEN

but	O
none	O
so	O

A	O

 	O
However	O

with	O
the	O

that	O
