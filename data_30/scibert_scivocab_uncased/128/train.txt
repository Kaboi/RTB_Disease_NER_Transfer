Previous O

CBSV B-PATHOGEN

This O

because O

In O

we O

Using O
the O

we O
produced O
the O
first O

This O

the O
finding O
that O

a O

All O

CBSV B-PATHOGEN

Abstract O
Early B-DISEASE

Alternaria B-PATHOGEN

The O

However O
, O
A. B-PATHOGEN

are O
both O
crossable O
with O

, O
that O
show O
promising O

The O
cross O
between O
resistant O
S. B-CROP
berthaultii I-CROP
and O
a O
susceptible O
diploid O
S. B-CROP

This O
cross O
resulted O
in O
triploid O
progeny O
in O
which O
resistance O

inherited O
dominantly O
. O
This O
is O
somewhat O

, O
as O
resistance O
against O

Because O

we O

These O

We O

that O

that O

only O
( O

. O
We O
show O
that O
the O
resistance O
in O
those O

is O
not O
a O
restriction O
of O

due O
to O

for O

, O
thus O

When O

, O
only O
a O

indicating O
that O

while O
the O
presence O

in O
the O

provided O

In O

Thus O

which O

a O

indicating O
that O

the O

Summary O
The O
single‐stranded O
, O
positive‐sense O
RNA O
genome O
of O
viruses O
in O
the O
genus O
Potyvirus O
encodes O
a O
large O
polyprotein O
that O
is O
cleaved O
to O
yield O
10 O
mature O
proteins O
. O
The O
first O
three O
cleavage O
products O
are O
P1 O
, O
HCpro O
and O
P3 O
. O
An O
additional O
short O

( O

) O
, O
called O

, O
overlaps O
the O

. O
Four O

potyviruses O
infecting O
sweet B-CROP
potato I-CROP
( O
Ipomoea B-CROP

) O
are O
predicted O
to O
contain O
a O
third O
ORF O
, O
called O
pispo O
, O
which O
overlaps O
the O
3′ O
third O
of O
the O
P1 O
region O
. O

Recently O
, O
pipo O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
expressed O
via O
polymerase O

at O
a O

. O
Here O
, O
we O
show O
that O
pispo O
is O
also O
expressed O
via O
polymerase O
slippage O
at O
a O
GA6 O
sequence O
, O
with O
higher O
slippage O
efficiency O
( O
∼5 O

than O
at O

but O
only O

These O
results O
reveal O
that O

not O
