As	O

the	O

There	O
are	O
diseases	O
that	O

for	O
example	O
,	O
Dioscorea	B-CROP

 	O
The	O
cost	O
of	O

is	O
another	O
major	O
challenge	O
.	O
As	O
this	O
crop	O
is	O
a	O
vine	O
,	O
every	O
plant	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O

The	O
lack	O
of	O

makes	O
both	O
planting	O

very	O
labor	O

kilos	O
,	O
and	O
each	O

Another	O
challenge	O
is	O
the	O

itself	O

As	O
yams	B-CROP

a	O
clonally	O

keep	O
some	O
as	O

This	O
becomes	O
very	O
difficult	O

 	O
Lastly	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
the	O
need	O
for	O

the	O

do	O
n't	O

about	O
